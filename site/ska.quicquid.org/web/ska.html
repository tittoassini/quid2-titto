Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Wikipedia</H1>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 2.54cm; margin-top: 0.42cm"><I>In
many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of
the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great
Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge
and wisdom, for though it is inaccurate, it scores over the older,
more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly
cheaper; and second, it has the words DON'T PANIC inscribed in large,
friendly letters on its cover (Douglas Adams).</I></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">When I
was fourteen, my family was visited by an eager encyclopaedia
salesman who was promoting the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.britannica.com/">Encyclopaedia
Britannica</A></U></FONT>. What he proudly presented us was the most
amazing work of knowledge I had ever seen. The Britannica had
everything to impress an avid young reader. The quality of its
contributors was unmatched, Einstein and Freud had written articles
for it. The breadth of the work was immense, with tens of thousands
of entries. And it was not just its many spiritual qualities that
made it stand out, Britannica was also a beautiful object to behold.
Just holding one of these beautiful leather-bound volumes gave me a
kick. The thing even smelled good! The Encyclopaedia Britannica
really oozed quality from the pores of its high-strength paper (the
salesman could not resist demonstrating that a single page would
happily hold the weight of a whole volume). Unfortunately, at the
time, the price of the Britannica in Italy was equivalent to roughly
two months of a white-collar salary so, with some regret, I advised
my parents not to buy it.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">I am
now considerably older and slightly wealthier than I used to be and
recently, to satisfy that juvenile desire, I bought a copy of the
Britannica. Not the expensive and beautiful print version, that would
not fit on my little and already overloaded bookshelf anyway, but
rather the cheap and handy electronic versions. It has the same
contents of its most illustrious relative but it costs only a few
tens of dollars and it will follow me everywhere my notebook computer
will, that in this days it is most places.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
fact that a knowledge product of the size and sophistication of the
Britannica, traditionally reserved to the enjoyment of the middle and
upper classes, is now sold at a price that makes it accessible to
just about everybody speaks volumes about the huge impact that
electronic publishing is having in democratising the access to
knowledge in our society.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">But
the most amazing development in my long love affair with Britannica
it is not so much the fact that, many years after falling in love
with it, I was finally able to fulfil my desire. Oh no, life (and
love) is much more complicated than that. The most unexpected twist
to the story is that, shortly after becoming a proud owner of the
Britannica and while I was looking forward to many years of happy
life in common, I started neglecting her. As a matter of fact,
nowadays I use my long-desired Britannica quite rarely as, to satisfy
my frequent and urgent encyclopaedic needs, I mostly prefer to use
<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</A></U></FONT>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
Britannica and Wikipedia could hardly be more different. The
Britannica is nothing short of an institution. It is in fact the
oldest encyclopaedia in the English language, first published in
1768<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>.
Its development has being one of the most expensive publishing
enterprises ever. Its contributors are leading authorities in their
fields and their output it is carefully checked by a little army of
keen-eyed editors. Its typesetting, its graphics, its contents are
all carefully and professionally choreographed. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Enter
now the world of Wikipedia. Do it with caution as it is so much more
slippery than the ordered and predictable one you have just left
behind. The Wikipedia authors/editors (as there is basically no
difference between them) range from university professors to
high-school dropouts. It is hard to say really as absolutely anybody,
including anonymous users, has the right to edit any Wikipedia
article. Wikipedia also totally lacks a respectable pedigree. It was
started only in January 2001 and, hear hear, not by an academic
institution or a respected publisher but by a small Internet company
whose main source of income was the sale of erotic images<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A></SUP>.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Despite
its recent and plebeian origins, the English Wikipedia is by far the
most extensive encyclopaedia ever assembled with more than 900.000<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A></SUP>
articles vs. the about 120.000 of the online version and the 50.000
of the printed edition of the Britannica. When it comes to actual
usage, according to the independent Internet ranking service <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</A></U></FONT>,
Wikipedia attracts about fifteen times more users than the Britannica
online version<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A></SUP>.
Wikipedia has already spawned versions in more than one hundred
languages with thirty of them having more than 10.000 articles<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A></SUP>.
The total number of articles in all languages is close to two
millions.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Being
a bit of a book worm, the discovery of Wikipedia has been of
particular interest to me but naturally the same pattern can be seen
in a variety of different fields. Maybe you had your epiphany when
you discovered that you liked Linux better than Windows and wondered
how a team of volunteers that, in their large majority, have never
met face to face could have produced an operating system of such
complexity and sophistication. Or maybe when you marvelled at the
uncanny ability of Google in returning just the right answer to your
queries, picking up the very Web page you were after among billions.
What lies behind Wikipedia, Linux, Google and many other cornerstones
of the Internet is a new capacity of harnessing the collective
intelligence of people from all over the planet to create knowledge
products that are unsurpassed in their breath and sophistication.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">As it
is so often the case, this is both big news and no news. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">It is
no news in the sense that the ability of harnessing collective
intelligence and knowledge has always been a major driving force in
the cultural evolution of mankind. The best example probably being
the very language that I am using to write these words: English. As
all human languages, English is certainly not the product of the
genius of a single individual but rather the result of the merging of
the contributions of thousands of individuals, and of the judgments
on these contributions expressed by millions of people, over
centuries. Markets, the best mechanism known to man for the efficient
allocation of economic resources, are another example of collective
knowledge in action that has been exploited since time immemorial.
Representative democracy, with its voting systems and collective
deliberation bodies, is also an illustration of the central place
that collective intelligence has in our society. Indeed, the fabric
of society is woven with systems that extract, merge and apply
collective knowledge and intelligence.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">But it
is also big news, because the breath and depth of our ability of
exploiting our &lsquo;global brain&rsquo; is been increased a hundred
folds by the recent advancements in information and telecommunication
technologies. The billion people or so that currently have access to
the Internet are often seen just as potential customers: eyeballs for
commercials or one more passive audience for the entertainment
industry. But the winners of the Internet revolution are those who
have realised that the real goldmine, indeed by far the biggest and
most valuable natural resource on the planet, is the knowledge and
judgment of these people. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">It is
hard to say if we are on the brink of a revolution in the way we
learn, work and govern ourselves or if on the contrary we will end up
discovering that the factors that limit human cooperation are
impervious even to the attack of the latest technologies. What it is
certain, though, is that if your favourite drug is knowledge being
addicted has never felt so good.</P>
<H1 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="hn5"></A>
Overview</H1>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The great advancements in computing and telecommunication
technologies that have taken place in the last few decades have
hugely reduced the cost of publishing information. Professionally
produced content &ndash; such as newspapers, music, software and
books &ndash; created by media companies and independent authors is
accessible to a greater audience than ever before. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Even more importantly, they have made possible novel forms of large
scale cooperation and knowledge production and sharing. Millions of
people from all over the world have engaged themselves in knowledge
creation activities that were previously reserved to an elite. Many
are the valuable products that have already come out of the
collective knowledge cornucopia including encyclopedias, knowledge
classification schemes, news and commentary sites, and very
sophisticated software. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
possibility of exploiting, in an unprecedented measure, the
collective intelligence and knowledge (dare we say wisdom?) of the
human race, has profound implications and rises questions of all
kinds: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Political:
	What new forms of political participations are possible? Could this
	lead to a transfer of power from governments and big corporations to
	the general public? How does it alter the concept of citizenship? Is
	there such a thing as a &ldquo;network citizenship&rdquo;? 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Economical:
	Are we witnessing the emergence of a new model of production? Will
	the knowledge products of the future be produced by teams of
	volunteers and made available for free for everybody to enjoy? Will
	this help bridge the gap between developed and developing world or
	will the digital divide grow even wider? In what sectors is this new
	model applicable? Is it efficient and sustainable? How does it
	compare with market or firm driven production? 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Sociological:
	What kind of social contracts and institutions facilitate the
	creation and sharing of knowledge? How to foster cooperation,
	avoiding free-riding and the tragedy of the commons? How to build
	durable social networks, cemented by mutual trust and respect, in a
	geographically distributed environment? 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Legal:
	How should intellectual property and freedom of speech be regulated
	in order to foster the creation and sharing of knowledge? 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Technical:
	What technologies are needed to support the publishing,
	preservation, sharing and aggregation of knowledge on such a massive
	scale? 
	</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
aim of this work is not to tackle directly these questions but, much
more modestly, to collect and examine the common principles and
patterns that underlie some of the existing success stories in this
field. Hopefully, this will lead to a better understanding of the
existing social knowledge applications and facilitate the design of
even more useful applications.</P>

scale, quantity decreases (wisdom is rarer than knowledge that is
rarer than information that is rarer than data). 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What is the conceptual difference among these levels? A common answer
is that they correspond to &ldquo;know-nothing&rdquo;, &ldquo;know-what&rdquo;,
&ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and &ldquo;know-why&rdquo;. To make this more
concrete, think of a game like chess. With respect to chess, data
would be the knowledge of the positions of the pieces on the
check-board during a given game; information would be the knowledge
of the rules of the game, and therefore of the state space, the set
of all admissible game states; knowledge would be knowing how to
play, the strategies and tactics; and, finally, wisdom would be
knowing why we play, how this act fits into the context of human
society and in the players&rsquo; life.</P>

As Karl Marx pointed out over a century ago, the economic structure,
or mode of production, is the basic framework into which social,
political and intellectual activities take place:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In the social production of their existence, men
inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of
their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given
stage in the development of their material forces of production. The
totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic
structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal
and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms
of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life
conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual
life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their
existence, but their social existence that determines their
consciousness.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="#sdfootnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

The world economy is still dominated by the mode of production that
Marx witnessed and that dates back to the Industrial Revolution, but
at its core a major change is taking place, the shift from the
production of physical goods to that of informational goods:</P>

&hellip; <FONT SIZE=2>ideas and innovations have become the most
important resource, replacing land, energy and raw materials. As much
as three-quarters of the value of publicly traded companies in
America comes from intangible assets, up from around 40% in the early

And in the production of informational goods another major shift is
taking place, from commercial to cooperative production. We can see
it clearly in the Web where the capacity of extracting and
integrating social knowledge already plays a major role. Two out of
three of the most popular Web sites are already &ldquo;powered&rdquo;
by social knowledge. Among the 15 more popular Web sites in English<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A></SUP>,
five publish professionally produced content (Microsoft, AOL, Go,

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
We are entering the age of the collective production of information.
And just as the mass-trained workers of the Industrial Revolution
could produce more, and more sophisticated, goods than the skilled
artisans of yore, the unwashed, but Internet savvy, masses of the
Knowledge Revolution might reveal themselves more productive, in many
domains, than the knowledge artisans of today: academics, journalists
and assorted experts.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Power is of those who own, or otherwise control, the essential means
of production of their age. Who will control the essential
infrastructure of the knowledge age? Currently, the vast majority of
intellectual property is in private hands and most cooperatively
produced content is also privately appropriated. Increasingly,
however, the products of the collective intellectual toil are been
released under open content licenses. The pool of communally owned
knowledge goods, the &ldquo;Creative Commons&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP>,

This radically alters the relationship between capital and
(intellectual) labour. If tomorrow all employees of Microsoft were to
walk out and leave, Microsoft would still be a very valuable company
as it owns the intellectual property that underlies most of the
current computing infrastructure. If all the employees of Red Hat, an
open source company, left the company, Red Hat would be worthless.
The value of Red Hat is entirely in the skills of its employees.

	The complex and multidisciplinary nature of the object of analysis

Patterns</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The basic methodological assumption that will be adopted in this work
builds on and extends Alexander&rsquo;s proposal and can be expressed
as follows: social knowledge applications can be understood, and new
applications designed, by combining a set of<I> patterns</I> that
operate in the context of some basic <I>principles</I>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Principles and patterns are both necessary to form a complete picture
of these phenomena.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
A principle is a universal proposition, an assertion that it is true
for all the elements of a certain (usually very large) set.
Principles come under different labels: laws, theorems, principles,
rules, maxims, according to the extension of the set to which they
apply and the level of formalization and precision with which they
are expressed. Examples range from mathematical principles such as
the principle of recursion to folk philosophy maxims such as &ldquo;money
cannot buy happiness&rdquo;. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Principles explain how the world works but they don&rsquo;t specify
how to make the world work for us. For example, the knowledge of the
principles of thermodynamics is a necessary but not sufficient
precondition to inform the design of a working internal combustion
engine. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Still, principles are essential because they provide a conceptual
framework that limits and orientates our search for working solutions
to concrete design problems. If, for example, you were to wake up one
morning with the idea of designing a perpetual motion machine, a
quick check of the principles of thermodynamics would inform you that
such a machine is impossible and save you a lot of unnecessary
effort. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Informing us on how to make the world work for our own ends is the
job of patterns. Patterns are the conceptual building block that
designers use to build new solutions and that researchers use to make
sense of existing ones.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The structure of the text reflects the methodological approach
adopted. It is divided into three parts: applications, patterns and
principles. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
first part is an analysis of a significant social knowledge
application. The analysis is rather brief, as its main objective is
not so much to describe in detail the inner workings of the system
but rather to show the utility of patterns and principles as an
explanatory device for the application behaviour and performance. The
case study examined is Wikipedia, the cooperatively edited and open
content online encyclopedia. Wikipedia, because of the ambitiousness
of its objective of creating a summary and a gateway to all
knowledge, is one of the best examples of large-scale knowledge
integration.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The second part is a catalogue of some of the patterns that play an
important role in SKAs and that are used in the case study analysis.
Patterns are grouped according to the key issues that SKAs have to
solve in order to operate successfully and efficiently (see
<A HREF="#hn23">Patterns</A>).</P>

Primitive boats come in two basic shapes: the canoe, that can be made
out of hollowed-out tree trunks using only the simplest tools, and
the raft, that can be built even more easily by binding logs. The
advantage of the canoe is that it is fast and manoeuvrable, the
disadvantage is that it has a very limited living space and carrying
capability. The raft has opposite characteristics: slow and difficult

As its name indicates, Wikipedia is also a blend of two very
different, if not all together opposite, technologies: the online
encyclopedia and the Wiki.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
A Wiki is essentially a Web site that can be easily edited by remote
users. Wikis are designed to minimise the effort of editing Web
pages. Users do not need to install any special software, apart from
a standard Web browser, and they write text into a &lsquo;shorthand&rsquo;
notation that it is designed to be easier to learn and to use than
the full HTML language (the language in  which Web pages are
written). The other striking feature of Wikis is that they usually
have a very open access policy, often allowing anyone to edit any
page. Online systems usually defend themselves from intrusions and
attacks by giving the right of modifying contents only to a few
trusted users. Wikis take a different approach: anyone can create a
new version of a page and the last created version immediately
becomes the &lsquo;official&rsquo; version that users see by default.
However, all the previous versions of the page are preserved and they
can be easily accessed and reinstated as the &lsquo;official&rsquo;
version making it easy to reverse the effects of vandalism or
inconsiderate editing. It might sound like a paradox, but Wikis can
afford to be open to unrestricted, unsupervised, editing precisely
because, literally speaking, they cannot be &lsquo;edited&rsquo; at
all: you can add information to a Wiki but you cannot remove or
modify existing information<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote29anc" HREF="#sdfootnote29sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
After seeing the great success of Wikipedia, the idea of using a Wiki
to build a encyclopedia might seems fairly natural. This was
definitely not the case, as it is proven by the chronology of the
appearance of these technologies. Both online encyclopedias and Wiki
systems predate Wikipedia by a number of years. The first Wiki system
was launched in 1995 <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote30anc" HREF="#sdfootnote30sym"><SUP>30</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>
<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote31anc" HREF="#sdfootnote31sym"><SUP>31</SUP></A></SUP>
and the Encyclopaedia Britannica was already available online as
early as 1994<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote32anc" HREF="#sdfootnote32sym"><SUP>32</SUP></A></SUP>
while Wikipedia was launched only in 2001. So, it has taken no less
than 6 years, an eternity in Internet time, for someone to realise
the explosive potential of the combination of these two technologies.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In effect, the editing process of a Wiki and that of a traditional
encyclopedia could hardly be more different. Wikis usually accept
contributions from everybody while traditional encyclopedias rely
only on distinguished experts. In a Wiki, editing and publishing are
a single process with new edited versions being immediately visible
to the public while in a traditional encyclopedia the processes of
editing and publishing are completely separate activities. Finally,
Wikis are often used as a debating ground as much as a way of
collecting knowledge with single voices maintaining their
independence while one of the distinguishing features of an
encyclopedia is that, though by necessity it is always the product of
the work of hundreds of authors, it speaks with a single, &ldquo;objective&rdquo;
voice. Having combined the openness and productivity of the Wiki with
the requirements of objectivity and adherence to the facts of an
encyclopedia was therefore far from evident and can indeed be
considered a bold and inspired design choice.</P>

Has Wikipedia achieved its declared goal? To answer this question we
need to examine separately a number of different aspects relative to
the format as well as the quantity and quality of Wikipedia contents.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
First of all, is Wikipedia, an encyclopaedia at all? Encyclopaedias
are a specific literary genre with their own structure and rules. In
particular we would expect a encyclopaedia to:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Provide a very wide coverage (encyclopaedic in fact) of its subject.
	In the case of a general encyclopaedia such as Wikipedia that means
	coverage of the totality of human knowledge.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Be structured as a collection of entries relative to specific
	objects or concepts.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Be written in a formal, &ldquo;objective&rdquo; style.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Even a quick browse of Wikipedia should be sufficient to reassure
anybody that it easily matches the first two criteria: its coverage
is indeed encyclopaedic and it is broken down in a high number of
entries, each meant to illustrate a particular object or concept. The
third criteria, though, is harder to assess. While most articles in
Wikipedia are clearly written in the formal style typical of a
reference work, it is possible to find counter examples of articles
containing personal comments as well as colloquial, humorous or
possibly even offensive language. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This high variability in style and quality is naturally due to the
dynamic nature of Wikipedia. Being subject to continuous editing from
thousands of authors, not all of the same quality and experience, as
well as to the attacks of vandals and spam spreaders, there is always
a certain fraction of Wikipedia content that is of sub-standard

If Wikipedia coverage is extremely wide, its depth, that is to say
the amount of information available on each subject, is still
relatively limited with an average of 345 words per article. This 
compares well with other online encyclopedias such as the Columbia

Even if this were not to happen, it is likely that, given the

So, how reliable, accurate and authoritative is the average Wikipedia
article? And, even more importantly, is Wikipedia overall quality
decaying or improving with time? After all, as Wikipedia is still in

One thing that can be excluded is a progressive massive deterioration
of the quality of existing articles. Though articles can be
occasionally vandalised or mutilated beyond recognition, the fact
that all previous versions of Wikipedia articles are preserved by the
system and can be very quickly reinstated and the presence of an
active group of editors that continuously check the most recent
changes makes Wikipedia very resilient to malicious attacks<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote47anc" HREF="#sdfootnote47sym"><SUP>47</SUP></A></SUP>.
Vi&eacute;gas, Wattenberg and Dave have conducted a first study of
the patterns of evolution of Wikipedia articles. One of their results
is that vandalism is normally repaired very quickly<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote48anc" HREF="#sdfootnote48sym"><SUP>48</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.
in fact, the more egregiously vandalic the attack and the easier and
faster it is to detect and fix it. As mentioned in the previous
extract from Wikipedia, much more problematic to spot are subtler
modifications, like the change of a date or of other detailed aspects
of an article. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Occasionally, however, major slippages can occur and remain
undetected for a long time. This has been the case of the Wikipedia
entry on John Seigenthaler Sr. <SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote49anc" HREF="#sdfootnote49sym"><SUP>49</SUP></A></SUP>,
a respected American journalist, that contained for a period of over
four months a number of libellous allegations <SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote50anc" HREF="#sdfootnote50sym"><SUP>50</SUP></A></SUP>.
The author of the libel was an anonymous user, that has later been
identified, whose intention was to play a prank on a colleague that
was a personal acquaintance of the Seigenthaler family. The page was
not referenced by any other Wikipedia page and probably received
close to no traffic and therefore escaped the attention of
Wikipedia&rsquo;s watchdogs. When Seigenthaler has discovered the
existence of his doctored biography, he has published a very critical
article that has been widely cited and that has significantly damaged
the image of Wikipedia. As a result of this incident, anonymous users
have been barred by creating new articles, though they can still edit
existing entries. It has also rekindled the long running discussion
in the Wikipedia community on how to provide an explicit assessment
of the quality of an article<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote51anc" HREF="#sdfootnote51sym"><SUP>51</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Seigenthaler&rsquo;s case is interesting for two reasons. On one
side, it provides a vivid illustration of the risks involved in a
system like Wikipedia. On the other side, the fact that Mr
Seigenthaler has felt the need to write an article on a major
newspaper to refuse the allegations of the fake biography and to
denounce the unreliability of Wikipedia is, paradoxically, a proof of
the growing importance of Wikipedia as a reference work. Certainly,
if the allegations had appeared on an unknown Web site, his reaction
would have been quite different. His case is a harbinger of a not too
distant future when, as the default World Wide Encyclopedia,
Wikipedia&rsquo;s influence will be so great that individuals,
corporations, and even nations will want to keep a continuous watch
on what it says about them. This might both improve its accuracy, as
factual errors will be more likely to be corrected, as well as
stultify its contents as an army of PR people descends on Wikipedia
to fix its contents to their clients&rsquo; advantage. A taste of
what might be happening is given by the recent incident where Adam
Curry, one of the inventors of podcasting (a system to automatically
download audio and video programs to Apple&rsquo;s iPods and similar
portable players), logged in anonymously to Wikipedia and edited the
podcasting entry<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote52anc" HREF="#sdfootnote52sym"><SUP>52</SUP></A></SUP>
to remove references to the role played by another podcasting
pioneer<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote53anc" HREF="#sdfootnote53sym"><SUP>53</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.
In this case, Wikipedia&rsquo;s editorial process worked admirably
well, Curry&rsquo;s biased alterations were quickly detected and
undone and his identity traced obliging him to apologise.

If the self-defence mechanisms present in Wikipedia guarantee that
the quality of an article cannot significantly decrease in time, it
is reasonable to assume that the only direction left is up. Lih<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote54anc" HREF="#sdfootnote54sym"><SUP>54</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>
has implicitly adopted this point of view, by measuring the quality
of an article as a function of diversity, defined as the number of
unique editors, and rigour, defined as the total number of edits. If
we accept this approach then clearly, with time, the overall quality
of Wikipedia can only increase. This line of reasoning, though, feels
uncomfortably like a <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petitio_principii">petition

The most direct way of assessing accuracy and overall quality is to
have a team of professional librarians or domain experts to check the
facts contained in a statistically significant sample of Wikipedia
articles with respect to known reliable sources. One such study has
been recently carried out by Nature, in the form of a peer-review of
equivalent entries on scientific subjects in Wikipedia and the
Encyclopaedia Britannica. The main conclusion is that the accuracy of
Wikipedia is only slightly inferior to that of its more illustrious
competitor:

Wikipedia articles, however, were criticised for their poor
readability and structure. This suggests that  the aspect of
encyclopedic writing more impervious to a distributed mode of editing
is not the collection and checking of facts but rather the
integration of facts in a coherent whole. This is not surprising, 
while adding new facts to an existing article is a relatively low
cost operation reorganising the contents of an article is a much
greater task and, critically, a task that can not be easily

Unfortunately, peer reviews are extremely time consuming and no
regular series of such studies, that might reveal how the quality of
Wikipedia is changing in time, has been conducted yet. Luckily, an
automatic and usually reliable indirect measure of the
authoritativeness of Web resources, such as Wikipedia entries, is
available in the form of search engines ranks. Many search engines,
and in particular Google, use ranking algorithms that attribute a
higher score to the Web pages that are more widely cited (linked) by
other pages. So, the Google rank of a Wikipedia entry can be seen as
an assessment, performed by a high number of independent agents, of
the value of that entry with respect to all the other Web pages that
discuss the same subject <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote56anc" HREF="#sdfootnote56sym"><SUP>56</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>

frequently near the top of Google&rsquo;s result lists but proper

Authoritativeness is a major, but not the only, component of the
overall quality of a reference work. Another important aspect of
quality, which is not mentioned explicitly among the Wikipedia goals
but that certainly has great importance for the user of any
encyclopedia, is how up to date the encyclopedia contents are. Even
in areas of knowledge, such as philosophy, that evolve relatively
slowly and that are less influenced by recent events and technical
advancements the glacial update pace of traditional encyclopedias has
been a major problem. Indeed, the necessity of an updated
encyclopedia was the main justification for the creation in 1997 of
the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote61anc" HREF="#sdfootnote61sym"><SUP>61</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>,

their yearly publishing cycles and prohibitively high cost make them
ill-suited for the task. Even conventional online encyclopedias, such

We are now in a position to answer our initial question: has
Wikipedia  achieved its goal? The conclusion can only be positive:
Wikipedia has succeed, in just a few years, in creating an authentic
encyclopedia whose breadth is unprecedented, whose depth is
reasonable and improving, whose reliability is hard to measure but
apparently also improving and whose overall usefulness as a reference
work for the general public, if not necessarily for academic or
specialised audiences, is unequivocally attested by the exponential
growth of its popularity.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
We are now ready to start examining some of the principles and
patterns that underlie Wikipedia amazing success.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><A NAME="hn15"></A>Birth and Growth
of Wikipedia</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The exponential growth in Wikipedia&rsquo;s usage and size is the
hallmark of systems whose utility grows with usage. At the core of
Wikipedia&rsquo;s growth there is a virtuous cycle: the greatest the
quantity of information it contains, the greatest its usefulness and
the number of readers-authors that it can attract, leading in turn to
further growth in content. Once the virtuous cycle has started, it is
virtually unstoppable and it leads to logistic growth, that is to say
essentially exponential growth till it approaches the saturation
point (see <A HREF="#hn56">Principles of Network Utility</A>). As
Wikipedia is still in its infancy, we can expect its explosive
expansion to continue for a long time.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The difficulty lies entirely in starting the virtuous cycle. At the
time of their launch, systems whose value depend on their usage are
at a serious disadvantage as, inevitably, they have no users. This
lead to a vicious, rather than virtuous, cycle: no users mean no
value and therefore no way of attracting more users. The risk is
that, rather than growing, the system will stagnate, unable to
&ldquo;bootstrap&rdquo; itself (see <A HREF="#hn65">Networks Have a
Bootstrapping Problem</A>).</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
On this regard, it is instructive to compare Wikipedia&rsquo;s
success with the failure of Nupedia, a previous attempt of the team
behind Wikipedia to create an online open-content encyclopedia <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote64anc" HREF="#sdfootnote64sym"><SUP>64</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.
The key difference between Nupedia and Wikipedia was in their
editorial model. Nupedia tried to emulate the traditional
encyclopedic editorial model. Authors were expected to have
demonstrable experience in their assigned subjects, mainly by holding
a relevant academic position, and the articles went through a
lengthy, multi-staged, editorial process of revision and checks. This
complex and selective process drastically reduced the number of
potential authors (see <A HREF="#hn45">Out of Mediocrity Excellence</A>)
and imposed a significant burden on prospective authors.
Unfortunately, as the value of Nupedia in its initial stage was very
low as the encyclopedia lacked in both contents and prestige, there
was very little incentive for authors to join the project. Costs
being greater than rewards, the inevitable result was that Nupedia
was able to complete only a negligible number of articles before
being superseded by Wikipedia and abandoned.

On the contrary, Wikipedia has successfully managed to solve its
bootstrapping problem by a combination of extremely low adoption
costs and a modest amount of &ldquo;start-up capital&rdquo;.
Everything in Wikipedia is geared to attract as many contributors as
possible and to reduce to the minimum the cost of participation. In
Wikipedia, authorship is literally just one click away. The start-up
capital was provided by &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; Wikipedia with the
contents of existing open-content reference works and by exploiting
part of the editorial team that had gathered around Nupedia (see

Value of Wikipedia</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">The
value of an economic good does not reside uniquely in its <I>intrinsic</I>
value, in what it is worth when used on its own, but also on its
<I>extrinsic</I> value that is produced by the combination of the
good with others to create more complex and valuable goods (see
<A HREF="#hn56">Principles of Network Utility</A>). Wikipedia itself
is a very successful combination of two ideas: the online
encyclopaedia and the Wiki cooperative authoring system. The
combination of these two ideas has a value that goes well beyond that
of its separate components. Wikipedia is vastly larger and more
valuable than any existing non-Wiki online encyclopaedia or any
non-encyclopaedic Wiki.

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Wikipedia
is particularly good at enhancing the value of its contents by making
them available in a way that it is favourable to recombination. It

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">One
very evident peculiarity of Wikipedia is the enormous amount of
self-reference. Wikipedia articles contain an extraordinary number of
references to other Wikipedia articles, on average there is one
internal link every 16 words. This is due both to the encyclopedic
nature of the work, that provides endless opportunities for
cross-reference, and to the low cost of creating internal links.
Creating a link to another Wikipedia article is as simple as typing
the article name in double brackets, as for example in  &ldquo;[[Italy]]&rdquo;.
It is even possible to create links to entries that do not yet exist.
These are displayed in a different colour than links to existing
articles and act as reminders of articles that should be written.</P>

Many users discover Wikipedia through search engines like Google,
while looking for information on some specific subject. Once they
have landed on their first Wikipedia article, however, they are
likely to start a much longer journey. In fact, one of the reasons
why Wikipedia can become so addictive is the incredible ease by
which, thanks to its dense interlinking, one can endlessly flow from
one subject to another. The feeling is that of navigating through a
huge collective associative memory rather than a loose assembly of
articles as in a traditional encyclopedia:

Another factor that ensures the long-term growth of Wikipedia&rsquo;s

has allowed the emergence of the many different mechanisms by which
the contents of Wikipedia are structured and made easily accessible.

Indirect Communication 
</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Wikipedians have at their disposal a wide array of one-to-one and one
to many communication mechanisms. Each registered user has a personal
page where messages can be left. A number of informal online
&ldquo;associations&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote68anc" HREF="#sdfootnote68sym"><SUP>68</SUP></A></SUP>
connect likely-minded members of the community. Many &ldquo;core&rdquo;
Wikipedians know each other identity so they can also communicate
directly using e-mail or other communication tools. Finally, a series
of national and international face-to-face meetings, including an
international conference, have been organised.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Direct communication, however, does not scale well and it would be
fanciful to believe that it could provide a suitable foundation for
coordination on such a large scale (see <A HREF="#hn33">Coordination</A>).
The hallmark of Wikipedia&rsquo;s coordination is indirect
communication. Coordination mainly takes place by &ldquo;working on
the same page&rdquo;, editing articles and reacting to edits made by
other participants. In a way not dissimilar to ants that coordinate
their foraging activities by reacting at chemical markers left on the
trails by their comrades, Wikipedians coordinate each other by
monitoring the flow of edits on the pages that concern them most (see
<A HREF="#hn34">Stigmergy</A>).</P>

It is only when this mechanism fails, when a conflict arises that
cannot be solved indirectly, that direct communication kicks in. The
first port of call are the &ldquo;Talk&rdquo; pages, of which one
exists for every entry. The &ldquo;Talk&rdquo; pages are a forum to
debate the contents of the corresponding encyclopedic entry. Talk
pages absorb and modularise conflict. Though there might be extremely
controversial views on certain subjects, the modular nature of the
Wikipedia debating system ensures that these conflicts remain
localised. If consensus cannot be reached, third parties can be

<FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">The first, and default

(which are only suggestions as far as the owner is concerned) &hellip;
Clearly this model resembles the familiar academic environment, where
a single author, or a group of authors (with a first author) creates
and revises the document, and is subject to external review from a
community of peers. This review takes the form of commentary which is
then integrated by the author or authors; the reviewer makes no
direct changes &hellip;. Some of the explanation for why this
&ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; paradigm is desired may be the high value
placed on uniformity and style of presentation as a distinct, unitary
work.</SPAN></FONT></P>

this model is that communal is best: allowing people to instantly
make changes to a document they come across will (allegedly) lower
the barrier of content creation to its optimal level, raising the net
productivity of the content management system. The owner in this

Krowne&rsquo;s observations capture the essential differences between
these two models. In the case of the traditional academic model, the
link between authorship and authority is established <I>a priori.</I>
Authorship implies ownership and therefore absolute authority on the
contents. Authority is exercised actively and continuously, no
changes can be made to the content unless the author directly applies
them. In the case of the Wiki model, as adopted by Wikipedia,
authorship and authority are disjoint as authorship does not imply
ownership. Authority is exercised only <I>a posteriori</I>,
reactively and discontinuously, when the checks and negotiations on
the contents carried out by the readers-authors fail to produce an
acceptable outcome.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Wikipedia&rsquo;s model of authority can be seen as a radical
application of the principle of subsidiarity (see <A HREF="#hn41">The

hierarchical organisation, each level of the hierarchy should perform
only those functions that cannot be efficiently performed at a lower

	As all encyclopedias, Wikipedia is broken into entries that can be

	editing process is even more so. The minimum effort required to
	contribute to Wikipedia is incredibly small. Entries are divided
	into sections that can be edited independently and there is no

	by fixing the spelling of a word or a misplaced comma. Indeed, it is
	so small that (minor) editing becomes a natural aspect of the
	process of using Wikipedia: you are reading an article, you spot a
	mistake, you fix it and move on with your reading. For seasoned
	Wikipedians, proof-reading becomes almost a subliminal activity. At

The value of a networked information system for a user often depends
from the total number of users and/or the total quantity of content
made available through the system. So, for example, the use value of
the telephone system depends on how many people are contactable
through the system. Similarly, the value of a newsgroup, a mailing
list or a wiki depends on the quantity of accessible information and
the number of reachable users. When a new system is launched, it
typically will not contain a significant quantity of information or
enjoy a significant user base. Lacking users and content its value to
prospective users is therefore zero. As new users have no incentive

In the context of network systems, the commensurate cost pattern
consists in keeping the adoption cost of a network lower than its
utility. As the network utility is mostly extrinsic and it is
initially very low this means that the adoption cost must also start
from a very low level, though it might increase later as the network
gets momentum.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
We are all familiar with the discounted introductory prices offered
by new telephone networks or online network services. By manipulating
prices, commercial operators can &ldquo;follow the utility curve&rdquo;
allowing the creation of an initial user base and progressively
raising the price of the network services as their utility increases.
This strategy obviously requires very deep pockets as operators might
have to sell services under cost for quite a long time.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Systems, such as open source software, that are available for free
have, <I>ceteris paribus</I>, a permanently lower adoption cost with
respect to equivalent commercial systems. Networks that are based on
open standards will usually also have free implementations giving
them an edge on networks based on closed proprietary standards.
Permanently low costs are also necessary for widespread adoption as
they constrain the maximum size reachable by the network (see
<A HREF="#hn65">Networks Have a Bootstrapping Problem</A>). This
explains why many of the most widely adopted Internet-based networks
such as e-mail, the WWW, instant messaging systems and the Voice on

Another element that affects early adoption and therefore the
possibility of overcoming the bootstrapping problem is the effect of
users&rsquo; expectations. So far, we have assumed that utility was a
function of the current level of usage of the network. Users,
however, do not take their decisions exclusively on the base of the
current situation but also on the base of their expectations
regarding the future<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote83anc" HREF="#sdfootnote83sym"><SUP>83</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.
So, if a user has a good reason to believe that the system will

utility function.

Alex Tew, an English university student, to raise money for his
studies, the site consists in a single 1000*1000 pixels image. The
one million pixels are on sale to advertisers at US$1 each, since the
name The Million Dollar Homepage. The value of the site to
advertisers depends on its ability of attracting eyeballs. The
intrinsic value of the site for people derives from the curiosity for
a novel and bold idea, the extrinsic value from the presence of
advertisement in an unusual and amusing format. For the virtuous
cycle of more advertisers leading to more users leading to more
advertisers to get started, some advertisers had to make the first
move. But why would early advertisers buy space on the site? They
could naturally see that, had the site caught up, it could have been
a very valuable advertising space. But, why not waiting for it to
gather momentum, so avoiding the risk of investing in a potential
failure? Had they done so, however, the popularity of the site would
have never surged. They invested because they expected the
advertising value of the site to spike but then to quickly decrease
as the novelty effect wore off and the arrival of more advertisers
diluted the advertising impact. This made it compelling for
advertisers to buy space as soon as possible. This solved the
bootstrapping problem, and .. has made its clever inventor quite rich
in a matter of a few months.

the terminology of existing human languages. The extent of the
Wikipedia addressing system is the set of all possible encyclopedic
subjects. This assumption is reinforced by the fact that Wikipedia
will respond to a request for an entry that doesn&rsquo;t exist with
an input form to enter the contents of the new entry. It is therefore

Networks that do not conform to the end-to-end intelligence pattern
are unable to deal with unexpected technological changes and are
eventually replaced by more flexible networks. Compare the different
fates of the telephone network and the Internet. Topologically, the
two networks are essentially identical, as both of them support
N-to-N communication on a world-wide scale. The telephone network,
however, is on its way out and it is being progressively replaced by
the Internet. What is the essential difference between the telephone
system and the Internet that explain the demise of one and the
success of the other? It is the fact that the Internet is a generic
network while the telephone network is specialised for the transfer
of voice.

The technical assumptions and optimisations that make the telephone

is such that even simple improvements in its voice carrying

<FONT SIZE=2>I contrast the flexibility of a Stupid Network with my
experience as a member of AT&amp;T's True Voice technical team. AT&amp;T
True Voice was a valiant attempt to improve circuit switched voice
quality as much as possible in the context of current network
architecture. If we had not been constrained by network architecture,
the easiest way would have been to increase the sampling rate or
change the coding algorithm. But to actually do this, we would have
had to change every piece of the telephone network except the wires.
So we had to work within the designed 64 kbit/s data rate. An astute
AT&amp;T perceptual psychophysicist &hellip; determined that voice
quality could be substantially improved by boosting the bass part of
the signal, that part of the audio spectrum between 100 and 300
cycles per second. But as we set out to implement this conceptually
simple improvement, we kept running into the problem that there were
too many places in the network that had built in &quot;intelligent&quot;
assumptions about the voice signal - echo cancellers, conference
bridges, voice messaging systems, etc. - and too many devices that
depended on these acoustic assumptions for their correct operation -
modems, fax machines, and a surprising number of strange devices with
proprietary analog protocols. After about two years of intense
effort, we made a noticeable difference, one that most listeners
preferred (if asked explicitly), but it was not as large as it could
have been. There was too much &quot;intelligence&quot; intertwined
with the basic transport. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote88anc" HREF="#sdfootnote88sym"><SUP>88</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

of the Internet is on its borders, in the network end-points. It is
embedded in specific applications like the Web, email or peer-to-peer
file distribution, rather than in the network itself. The Internet
&ldquo;stupidity&rdquo; makes it less efficient for the transfer of
some kind of information, such as voice, but has also made it into
the ultimate &lsquo;recombination&rsquo; technology, allowing the

<FONT SIZE=2>The remarkable social impact and economic success of the

characteristics that were part of its design. The Internet was
designed with no gatekeepers over new content or services. The
Internet is based on a layered, end-to-end model that allows people
at each level of the network to innovate free of any central control.
By placing intelligence at the edges rather than control in the
middle of the network, the Internet has created a platform for

Wikis are a prime example of the application of the end-to-end
intelligence pattern to social knowledge applications. Wikis have no
embedded &ldquo;business logic&rdquo;, the intelligence of the system
is provided by its users. Wikis are extremely simple, almost
primitive, shared text editing systems whose main components are just
pages and links. All that an user can do is to create new pages or
edit existing ones and create or remove links across pages. The Wiki
&lsquo;communication protocol&rsquo; is therefore utterly simple,
indeed simplistic if compared with most commercial Knowledge
Management systems. In its simplicity, however, lies its strength as
this basic protocol can be used to implement just about any
application. Wiki pages have been turned into articles, encyclopedia
entries, personal home pages, calendars, debating systems, voting
systems, scratchpads, classifications, thesauri, dictionaries and
much more.

In time, the patterns that emerge from the Wiki users&rsquo;
activities can be formalised and facilitated by the system. An
example are the many tags that Wikipedia has developed to mark pages
that &lsquo;require editing&rsquo; or &lsquo;whose neutrality is
disputed&lsquo; or those used to describe specific kind of entities
such as movies or biological species. Another example are the many
different mechanisms by which the contents of Wikipedia are
structured and made easily accessible. They range from the
&lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; links that connect equivalent articles in
different languages to the &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; lists or
taxonomies, or even dedicated portals,  that organise the material by
subject, time and a variety of other criteria. Commercial sites like
Amazon are also trying to take advantage of &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;
classifications and clustering, encouraging customers to create their
own personal lists of favourite products.

Large scale coordination is a key challenge for social knowledge
applications. SKAs typically involve large numbers of individuals:
Wikipedia, Linux, the Open Directory Project and other similarly
successful projects, have tens of thousands of collaborators. With a
vast community come an equivalently-sized coordination problem: how
are all these people that, in their large majority, have never met
each other and that are not bound by the constrains of any
traditional form of organisation, cooperate efficiently to realise a
common goal?</P>

The most direct answer to coordination problems it to increase
communication among the parties involved, but this is not likely to
work for large scale social knowledge applications. Communication
technology has naturally made huge advances in recent years and
without it SKAs would not even be conceivable. Direct communication,

is a behavioural pattern of social insects, such as termites or ants,
that coordinate their work activity by modifying their environment
and reacting to these modifications according to a few simple rules.
Social insects do not coordinate by obeying orders from a superior
authority, such as the nest Queen, or by direct communication. They
build their nest, or forage for food, by reacting to signs that they
themselves leave on the environment, for example by following a
pheromone-marked path to a source of food, or by carrying more food
to an existing food repository. Stigmergy allows social insects to
get scalable coordination without the need for explicit
communication<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote92anc" HREF="#sdfootnote92sym"><SUP>92</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>

in 1959. It derives from the Greek words <I>stigma,</I> meaning a
tattoo, sign or mark and <I>ergon</I> meaning work, indicating the
idea of coordinating work activities through signs and marks left on

Foraging ants use stigmergy both to optimise their search for food as

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Imagine a group of ants leaving their nest to forage. As they move
around they leave a trail of pheromone. The concentration of
pheromone will be higher near the nest and on well threaded paths.
Ants can therefore explore the surrounding environment in the most
efficient way by aiming for areas that contain lower quantity for
pheromone. When an ant has located a source of food it can find its
way back home by moving in the direction where the pheromone is
stronger. While the ants carrying food make their way home they also
release a second kind of pheromone. Ants that cross the path where
the food-marking pheromone has been laid will start moving in the
direction where it is stronger so locating the food. Ants carrying
food back to the nest might initially follow a number of different
paths but as the shortest path between the food and the nest it is
the one that will be more frequently threaded it will end up
collecting more pheromone so attracting more ants that, by laying
additional pheromone, will make it even more attractive. The result
is that ants will, in a short time, end up selecting and following <I>en
masse</I> the shortest possible path from the food to the nest.</P>

by black points when they are not carrying food and red points when
they are. Their nest is located in the lower right area. The food
source is located in the upper left area and is separated by the ant
nest by two obstacles, drawn in brown. We can see that there are two

You are driving down a country road when suddenly it starts snowing.
You are unfamiliar with the road, whose features are quickly
disappearing under the snow anyway. What are you to do? You spot a
car at some distance in front of you. Hoping that the driver in front

queue of vehicles that move in unison following each other.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Tailgating consists simply in coordinating by referring to an
external reference point such as:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	An existing product or service. For example: a commercial software

Tailgating has been particularly relevant for open source projects
that, especially in the past, have mainly consisted in
re-implementations of functionality available in commercial software
or in implementation of recognised standards. The most notable
example being GNU/Linux, a wide ranging and successful attempt to
create an open source version of the Unix system, including both its
kernel as well as its hundreds of additional tools. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The advantages of tailgating for open software development are pretty
evident. The hardest part of every software development project is in
deciding what functionality should be implemented and how it should
be broken down into a set of manageable modules. Cloning an existing
product, whose design is proven and well documented, hugely reduces
both the development effort and the need for explicit coordination.
In the case of the GNU/Linux project, there are hundreds of teams
that operate largely independently from each other as the modules
that they develop interoperate through the well-known interfaces
defined in the Unix standard.

Tailgating has indeed been such a prominent feature of early open

<FONT SIZE=2>Nonsense. In the open-source world, all it takes is one
person with a good idea. Part of the point of open source is to lower
the energy barriers that retard innovation. We've found by experience
that the `massive management' the author extols is one of the worst
of these barriers. In the open-source world, innovators get to try
anything, and the only test is whether users will volunteer to
experiment with the innovation and like it once they have. The
Internet facilitates this process, and the cooperative conventions of
the open-source community are specifically designed to promote it.
The third alternative to chasing taillights or strong central
leadership (and more effective than either) is an evolving creative
anarchy, in which there are a thousand leaders and ten thousand
followers linked by a web of peer review and subject to rapid-fire
reality checks. Microsoft cannot beat this. I don't think they can

<H4 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Problem</H4>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
As the &ldquo;heaven and hell&rdquo; story reminds us, it is critical
that human resources and tasks are correctly matched. The production
of good and services relies on the ability of harnessing sufficient
resources, human or otherwise. But having sufficient resources is no
guarantee of success. If resources are incorrectly combined the
result will be sub-optimal. The question then is: what is the
allocation procedure that provides the best results? Making sure, for
example, that Italians are employed as lovers rather than organisers
and Germans as mechanics rather than policemen? The problem is not
restricted to human resources, it applies to all resources that can
be used as inputs of a production process. Consider, for example, the
problem of determining if coal should be used to produce energy, as
in a thermoelectric plant; or to heat houses in winter; or to produce
plastics and other hydrocarbons-based chemicals.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The allocation problem is composed by two sub-problems: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	On the supply side: determining the production possibility frontier,
	that is to say all the combinations of goods that can be efficiently
	produced given the available factors of production and the current
	state of production technology.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	On the demand side: determining the social indifference map, that is
	to say the combinations of goods that provide the same utility to
	consumers.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The optimal allocation is then given by the intersection of the
production possibility frontier with the indifference curve with the
highest possible utility. In other terms, the allocation is optimal
when the factors of productions are used in the most efficient way
and they are used to produce the combination of products that
maximises the benefit for the consumers.

The diagram shows how this work for a simple economy with only two
goods. Each point on the diagram corresponds to a possible
combination of the two goods. MN is the production possibility
frontier and SI the social indifference curve. The point E is below
MN and therefore corresponds to an allocation of the factors of
production that is not optimal, as it is technically possible to
produce more of both goods with the same resources. D is on MN but
not on the highest possible SI, indicating that, while production is
efficiently done, social utility is not maximised. Z is the perfect
solution to the allocation problem: at this point production is
efficient and social utility is maximised.</P>

The theory is neat and simple, the real problem is to determine a
concrete mechanism to collect the necessary information and calculate
the optimal allocation. The allocation problem is central to both
economical theory and business practice and at least two different
solutions have been devised: centralised and market allocation.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><A NAME="hn38"></A>Centralised
Allocation</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In planned or command economies, a central planning board allocates
resources. In order to do so efficiently, it needs to collect
detailed information about: all the available factors of production,
the production function of all possible production processes and the
indifference map of every consumer. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Unfortunately, the very nature of centralised organisations makes it
very unlikely that they might be able to collect and process all the
required information. Centralised organisations are, by necessity,
hierarchical and a hierarchical organisation is like a game of
Chinese Whispers where information is progressively lost and, worse,
distorted when it passes from one level to the other up to the point
where informed decisions might become impossible<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote108anc" HREF="#sdfootnote108sym"><SUP>108</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.</P>

The previous table illustrates the problem. If we assume that, moving
from a hierarchical level to the next one up, 50% of the information
is preserved and 85% of it is transmitted correctly then, in an
organisation with 6 hierarchical levels, only 1.4% of the information
available at the lowest level reaches the top hierarchical level.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What is more, even the modest amount of information that would be
available to the central planners is unlikely to be of much use. For
information to flow to the higher hierarchical levels it has to be
filtered and aggregated but, as Hayek had already remarked over half
a century ago, &ldquo;knowledge of the particular circumstances of
time and place&rdquo; is necessary for the proper allocation of
economic resources:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>.. is knowledge of the kind which by its nature cannot
enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central
authority in statistical form. The statistics which such a central
authority would have to use would have to be arrived at precisely by
abstracting from minor differences between the things, by lumping
together, as resources of one kind, items which differ as regards
location, quality, and other particulars, in a way which may be very
significant for the specific decision. It follows from this that
central planning based on statistical information by its nature
cannot take direct account of these circumstances of time and place
and that the central planner will have to find some way or other in
which the decisions depending on them can be left to the &quot;man on
the spot&rdquo;. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote110anc" HREF="#sdfootnote110sym"><SUP>110</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The historic failure of centrally planned economies, that Hayek had
so clearly foreseen, has discredited the idea of planned allocation
of resources at the macro-economic level. However, explicit planning
is still applied almost universally, though on a much smaller scale,
in commercial companies and other formal organisations where
managers, relying on their knowledge of the resources under their
control and of the nature of the production process, decide how
resources should be allocated<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote111anc" HREF="#sdfootnote111sym"><SUP>111</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.
If the products are not traded on a market as it is the case, for
example, of services delivered by national health services, they also
need to explicitly determine the social indifference map, making
their task analogous to that of a central planner<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote112anc" HREF="#sdfootnote112sym"><SUP>112</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><A NAME="hn39"></A>Market Allocation</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In markets, allocation decisions are not centralised. Consumers
individually assess what the different products on offer are worth to
them, producers individually assess their production costs and the
market provides a way for those exchanges that are mutually
advantageous to take place.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Notwithstanding their apparent simplicity, competitive markets are
the most reliable and scalable mechanism for resource allocation. It
can indeed be proven that, under certain conditions, they lead to an
optimal allocation of resources<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote113anc" HREF="#sdfootnote113sym"><SUP>113</SUP></A></SUP>.
Though real markets only approximate the allocation efficiency of
perfectly competitive markets, it is fair to say, paraphrasing
Winston Churchill, that  &ldquo;market is the worst form of
allocation except for all those others that have been tried&rdquo;.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In real economies, markets and managed allocation are often
intertwined. For example, commercial companies will get the factors
of production from a competitive market, will then usually allocate
them internally managerially and will then compete in a market that
will direct production to its most useful uses and weed out
inefficient production choices.

The two mechanisms for resource allocation that we have briefly
examined are not easily applicable to the peer production model, that
is adopted by most open source and open content projects. These
project rely on the contribution of volunteers and produces goods
that are free for everybody to use. Volunteers cannot, by definition,
be coerced into working on specified projects so the planning option
is not available. Market allocation will not work either, as the most
important factor of production, human creativity, is not bought on
the market and the final products are not for sale.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Even if planning and market allocation could be used, they would be
unlikely to produce optimal results as they are not particularly
effective at allocating human resources. Both the managerial and
market solutions rely on a critical assumption: that the value of a

and objectively estimated. This might be true for coal<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote114anc" HREF="#sdfootnote114sym"><SUP>114</SUP></A></SUP>

As a concrete, if admittedly extreme, example of how hard it can be
to correctly value human creativity think of Albert Einstein. As a
young graduate he was not able to secure a teaching post and became a
clerk at the Berne Patent Office. Who could have predicted that, just
three years later, he would have had his Annus Mirabilis, during
which he wrote three papers (on Brownian motion, the photoelectric
effect, and special relativity), each of them worth a Nobel prize? An
year later, he was still working at the Patent Office and was
promoted to &ldquo;technical examiner second class&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote116anc" HREF="#sdfootnote116sym"><SUP>116</SUP></A></SUP>,
not exactly a fair estimate of his worth. He had to wait two more
years to get a modest academic position. In the next fifteen year, he
would produce the general theory of relativity and Bose-Einstein
statistics. He then embarked on the search for an unified field
theory. As the greatest scientist of the century and the prototypical
genius, nobody would have been considered more likely to reach this
goal. Tragically, he died thirty years later, his quest unfulfilled.
To summarise: if you had bet on his future achievements, based on the
value that had been assigned to him in the different phases of his
life, you would have certainly lost your house.

Subsidiarity</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Markets and well-designed organisational hierarchical organisations
share one common trait: they are both applications of the principle
of subsidiarity<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote117anc" HREF="#sdfootnote117sym"><SUP>117</SUP></A></SUP>.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The principle states that, in a hierarchical organisation, each level
of the hierarchy should perform only those functions that cannot be
efficiently performed at a lower hierarchical level. It was
introduced in economical and political theory by Catholic social
teaching, as a part of an attempt to define a third way between
unbridled capitalism and communism.  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The principle of subsidiarity underlies many important political and
economical institutions. It is a fundamental principle of the
European Union, limiting the scope of concerted EU action only to
those matters that cannot be satisfactorily tackled at the national
level. It appears in modern macro-economic management, where
governments and central banks control some of the basic economic
parameters such as the interest rate and taxation, but otherwise do
not directly intervene in the daily running of the economy. It also
plays a role in modern manufacturing systems as in the famous Toyota
Production System<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote118anc" HREF="#sdfootnote118sym"><SUP>118</SUP></A></SUP>,
where every worker has the authority of stopping the production line
if he detects an anomaly and where many productivity gains arise from
localised improvements, and in recent developments in organisational
theory<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote119anc" HREF="#sdfootnote119sym"><SUP>119</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Subsidiarity has both informational and motivational advantages. By
delegating the responsibility to take a decision to the lower
organisational level that can do so sensibly, it minimises the need
for information to travel through the hierarchy, so reducing
information loss. It also increases commitment as decisions are taken
by the same persons that have to carry them out or, at least, as
close as possible to them.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The principle of subsidiarity plays a key role in many open content
system. In Wikis, most functions that in traditional publishing
companies would be subject to strict managerial supervision, such as
authoring content and protecting the system against malicious
attacks, are largely delegated to the users themselves. Wiki&rsquo;s
administrators manage by exception, stepping in only in the most
extreme circumstances.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
We will now examine two simple patterns, based on the principle of
subsidiarity, that help peer production to operate efficiently in
absence of managed or market allocation. One, self-allocation,
operates on the supply side guaranteeing an efficient allocation of
human resources. The other, prosumer, operates on the supply side,
directing production where it matters. 
</P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><A NAME="hn42"></A>Self Allocation</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Self-allocation, or self-identification to use Benkler&rsquo;s
terminology, is the process by which workers, and in particular
creative workers, choose on their own what tasks to work on. This is
the usual way in which open content projects get staffed, people will
simply join the projects that they prefer. Self-allocation exploits
an unique advantage of human resources: while coal can only be traded
or allocated by officials and managers, humans can decide for
themselves what is the most productive usage of their time. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Self-allocation leads to an optimal allocation of creative resources.
It does so by aligning skills and motivations with the specific
nature of the tasks at hand. Consider the case of a software
developer that joins a team working on an open source program. The
enjoyment that he can get from this activity will be largely
dependent on how passionate he is about the program and on how well
his technical skills match the software requirements. If he is
motivated but incompetent, or competent but uninterested, it is
unlikely that he will get anything valuable out of this activity and
he will eventually quit. Also, if another open source project, that
provides an even better match for his personal aims and skills,
appears, he is free to switch. In time, therefore, only those that
are both motivated and competent, and whose skills cannot be better
used elsewhere, will tend to stick with a given project.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
As the best information available about the motivations and skills of
individuals is the one hold by the individuals themselves,
self-allocation can be more efficient than managerial or marker
allocation. Benkler sees it as strategic advantage of peer production
over management and market-driven models of production:</P>

in-house self-allocation might not be as efficient as the peer
production version, as the pool of available resources and tasks will
be smaller. 
</P>
<H4 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Applicability and Limitations</H4>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
While self-allocation might be the best way of allocating creative
resources, there is no guarantee that it will always produce correct
results. Self-delusion is not uncommon, people can be over-optimistic
about both their skills and the time and energy that they can afford
to allocate to a certain task. Self allocation is also highly prone
to manipulation, fake or malevolent contributions are a constant
threat. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The solution is to &ldquo;embed&rdquo; self-allocation in a system of
external checks. These can be &lsquo;market-like&rsquo;, as in the
cooperative news site Slashdot where everybody can propose a news
item but the value of the contributions is then assessed by the other
users through a sophisticated reputation system. Or they can be
&lsquo;managerial&rsquo; in nature, as in most open source projects
where new contributors are allowed access to the common source
repository only after having demonstrated their competence and
motivation, for example by providing patches or extension to the
software, and can have their privileges revoked at any time by the
project administrators. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
As previously mentioned, self allocation works on the supply side,
determining what is the most efficient combination of resources to
produce something, but not on the demand side, to determine what
should be produced and in what quantity. In other words: it
guarantees that the people who are best suited to work on a certain
project will do so; it does not, however, guarantee that, from a
social welfare point of view, the amount of effort invested in the
project will be optimal. Imagine a group of brilliant software
developers with a mathematical inclination that come together to
write a program to calculate a very large prime number. Though this
might be a lot of fun for them and their skills might be perfectly
suited to the task, that does not imply that this is time well spent.
Unless the developers preferences reflect those of the larger public,
the time that they will dedicate to a task might bear no relationship
to the social utility of the resulting product. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Therefore, to provide a complete allocation solution, self-allocation
needs to be coupled with a demand-side allocation mechanism. A
solution is for the production outputs to be traded on the market, as
market demand will provide the necessary information on the output
desirability. Another solution is the prosumer pattern.

pattern consists in abolishing, or at least reducing as far as
possible, the separation between producers and consumers. Prosumers
are consumers that steer the process of production directly, rather
than through the intermediation of a market, by either being
producers themselves or by influencing the producers activities.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
As customers influence the production process, they can lead it in
the direction that will provide more utility for them. A classical
example is that of a wealthy person who can get a personal architect
to design a house that perfectly matches his tastes.

The pattern is of great relevance to open content projects. In the
case of a Wiki, where everybody is both a reader and an author, the
amount of work spent working on an entry will be proportional to the
number of readers-authors that access the entry and to the importance
that they assign to the subject. In other terms, the amount of effort
invested in every entry will be proportional to its social utility.
In the case of open source projects that produce tools for
programmers, the developing team (or rather the user-developers
team<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote123anc" HREF="#sdfootnote123sym"><SUP>123</SUP></A></SUP>)
will closely match the profile of the customer base and it is likely
to create a high quality and useful product. Not so if the project
produces software meant for the general public. Indeed, the most

Customers participation do not need to be explicit or even conscious.
Consider the case of search engines like Google, that order Web
resources by relevance on the base of an analysis of the Web page
contents and the distribution of Web links. Web pages and links have
been created by a very large number of authors, that in aggregate are
likely to reflect rather closely the preferences of the whole online
community. As Google rankings are based on this information, in them
we see the reflection of our own collective mind.

The prosumer pattern appears prominently also in commercial
production. Marketing is largely about figuring out what customers
want, and how badly they want it, before the product appears on the

projects when production is organized on a market or firm model, but

When the World Wide Web started its explosive expansion people soon
realized that it would have been impossible to keep track of the

To understand what is going on, it is useful to shift our attention
to the more familiar world of physical, rather than virtual,
resources. Many important physical resources (e.g. precious metals or
oil) are normally found in deposits at very different degrees of
purity. Take gold, for example. Small quantities of gold can be found
in almost pure form as gold nuggets. A much greater quantity of gold,
though, is stored in gold ore where the concentration of the precious
metal is barely between 1 and 5 parts per million. This concentration
is so low that you could walk through a whole gold mine and never be
able to see, with your naked eye, a single speck of the metal. Even
greater quantities of gold are dissolved in sea water at
concentrations of a few parts per billion. A similar situation holds
for oil. According to current estimates, around two thirds of known
reserves are in low-grade tar sands rather than in high-grade oil
fields. The underlying principle seems to be that:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<I>The lowest the concentration of a resource the greatest the
overall quantity.</I></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This principle has a very important practical consequence: as our
technology improves and we are therefore able to exploit lower-grade
deposits, the total quantity of resources available increases by leap
and bounds. The importance of this fact can be hardly overstated.
Human population has been growing rapidly, for a period almost
exponentially, and this has been possible only because of a
correspondingly fast growth in the availability of key resources. The
economic history of mankind is, in fact, largely the history of our
increasing ability of exploiting lower-grade resources.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Data, information and knowledge, just like precious minerals or oil,
are also not distributed uniformly. A university textbook on physics
is certainly a higher-grade resource of knowledge than an email
exchange on Britney Spears. What applies to written records also
apply to human experts. Experts are the &ldquo;gold nuggets&rdquo; of
the knowledge world, concentrating in their brains large quantities
of the precious stuff. Laymen are the low-grade gold ore. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
But, does the principle that &ldquo;the lowest the concentration of a
resource the greatest the overall quantity&rdquo; applies to
knowledge? It is hard to say, as knowledge cannot be so readily
measured as a physical resource. If the principle holds, we would
expect 'knowledge refineries' that exploit lower-grade deposits to
produce a higher output of those who rely on higher-grade sources.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This is precisely what we observe in the human-edited directory vs.
automatically-build indexes battle. Both human-edited directories and
search engines ultimately rely on human-created links. The difference
is in the informational value of those links. The Yahoo directory is
a collection of high-quality editorial links (the &ldquo;gold
nuggets&rdquo;). Google&rsquo;s PageRank algorithm<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote128anc" HREF="#sdfootnote128sym"><SUP>128</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>,
on the contrary, operates on a much lower-grade kind of material:
links found in pages all over the Web, created by all kinds of users
for all kinds of purposes. What Google does is to refine this
low-grade informational ore into a reliable estimate of the relevance
of a Web resource. As there is much more information embedded in
low-quality sources than in high-quality ones, Google is eventually
able to produce a &ldquo;Web Map&rdquo; that is more extensive and
useful than any human-edited resource could ever possibly be.

The &ldquo;out of mediocrity, excellence&rdquo;<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote129anc" HREF="#sdfootnote129sym"><SUP>129</SUP></A></SUP>
pattern therefore consists in exploiting the lowest grade but overall
richest sources of knowledge. Another clear example of the pattern in
action is the case of online encyclopedias, as we can see by briefly
comparing the open-content Wikipedia with the Britannica. The
Britannica is the prototypical high-brow professionally edited
encyclopedia. Its contributors are leading authorities in their
fields (Einstein and Freud have contributed articles) and their
output is carefully checked by a little army of keen-eyed editors. On
the contrary, everybody is welcome to edit and contribute articles on
Wikipedia. The Britannica is, like an old-styled gold prospector,
after gold nuggets. Wikipedia, on the contrary, is after the gold
ore. It is a modern &ldquo;knowledge refinery&rdquo; that churns
great quantities of often minor and imperfect contributions into good
quality articles. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The greater efficiency of Wikipedia as a knowledge refinery with
respect to the Britannica can be easily verified. In a few years and
at trivial cost, the English version of Wikipedia has become by far
the most extensive encyclopedia ever assembled with over 800.000
articles (an additional 1.000.000 articles are available in the
Wikipedia editions in other languages) vs. the about 120.000 of the
online version and the around 50.000 of the printed edition of the
two hundred years old Britannica.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote130anc" HREF="#sdfootnote130sym"><SUP>130</SUP></A></SUP></P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Many social knowledge applications rely on automatic or
semi-automatic collection and processing of information. As machines
are not good at dealing with fuzzy and under-specified information,
an important consideration is the degree of formalisation of the
information that the SKA is called to process. From this point of
view, we can split the information universe in four main sets:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Latent: information that has never been &lsquo;written down&rsquo;
	in printed or electronic format, as it is the case of most of the
	private knowledge that humans hold about themselves and their
	surroundings.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Unstructured: information in electronic form, in free format, e.g.
	textual documents.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Structured: information whose syntactical structure is well-defined,
	e.g. a database table or an XML document structured according to a
	given DTD (Document Type Definition).</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
	Semantic: information whose meaning is well-defined.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
For the purpose of knowledge collection, these different classes of
information can be ordered along two main dimensions: the total
quantity of information available and the cost of converting the
information to a form that can be easily machine-processed.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The previous figure illustrates these two points. On the left, we
have an information pyramid that represents the relative abundance of
the different kinds of information. The rule is that there is a
relationship of inverse proportionality between degree of
formalisation and abundance. This is hardly surprising, capturing and
formalising knowledge is an expensive process and therefore we would
expect most information to be either latent or captured in the least
formal way. On the right, we have another pyramid that shows the
costs involved in processing the different kinds of information. The
general rule here is that the highest the degree of formalisation,
the easiest it is to process it automatically. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
There is one exception, though, that it is worth noticing and that in
the diagram is shown by the red arrow: there are some kinds of latent
information that are quite easy to capture and convert to a form that
it is suitable for processing. This specific capability of online
systems to quickly capture distributed latent knowledge underlies
many successful social knowledge applications. Consider for example
the case of eBay, that elicits and collects knowledge about all kind
of marketable goods. Most of this information is latent, private and
informal knowledge hold by millions of people about the most obscure
contents of their cupboards and garages. eBay can, quite easily and
cheaply, capture and formalise the few properties of these goods that
are required for the purpose of selling them (category, reserve
price, etc.) and uses this information to build a huge online market.
Another example is LinkedIn, that captures and concentrates largely
latent knowledge about social networks. As latent knowledge is the
most abundant form of knowledge, systems that can capture it
efficiently are, potentially, the most valuable type of social
knowledge applications.

<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western"><A NAME="hn47"></A>Modularisation</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Modularisation consists in breaking a task in sub-tasks that can be
executed in parallel. The smallest the size of the sub-tasks, the
greater the granularity of the project and the faster and easier it
is to carry it out in a distributed environment.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
As Benkler, among many others, has remarked, modular peer-production
systems have a distinct advantage in knowledge collection: 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>when a project of any size is broken up into little
pieces, each of which can be performed by an individual in a short
amount of time, the motivation to get any given individual to
contribute need only be very small. This suggests that peer
production will thrive where projects have three characteristics.
First, they must be modular. That is, they must be divisible into
components, or modules, each of which can be produced independently
of the production of the others. This enables production to be
incremental and asynchronous, pooling the efforts of different
people, with different capabilities, who are available at different
times. Second, the granularity of the modules is important and refers
to the sizes of the project&rsquo;s modules. For a peer production
process to pool successfully a relatively large number of
contributors, the modules should be predominately fine-grained, or
small in size. This allows the project to capture contributions from
large numbers of contributors whose motivation levels will not
sustain anything more than small efforts toward the project. Novels,
for example, at least those that look like our current conception of
a novel, are likely to prove resistant to peer production. In
addition, a project will likely be more efficient if it can
accommodate variously sized contributions. Heterogeneous granularity
allow people with different levels of motivation to collaborate by
making smaller- or larger-grained contributions, consistent with
their levels of motivation.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote131anc" HREF="#sdfootnote131sym"><SUP>131</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></P>

successive steps in the long march toward greater software
modularity<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote132anc" HREF="#sdfootnote132sym"><SUP>132</SUP></A></SUP>.
For software development, modularity has three many advantages: it
speeds up development by increasing the amount of programming effort
that can be applied in parallel; it simplifies the verification of
the correctness of a software program, as small modules can be tested
more easily; it increases the possibility of software reuse.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
These advantages, already critical for large-scale commercial
software development, have become salient in open source software
development. Coordinating a large open source development, such as
the Linux operating system, that involves thousands of geographically
and organisationally distributed developers, without the support of a
professional project management team would be unthinkable unless
there were ways of reducing the organisational complexity.
Consequently, Weber, in his analysis of the principles that underlay
Open Source development, stresses the importance of modularity as a
way of reducing both the technical and organisational complexity:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>The key to managing the level of complexity within the
software itself, is modular design&hellip;This reduces the complexity
of the system overall because it limits the reverberations that might
spread out from a code change. Obviously, it is a powerful way to
facilitate working in parallel on many different parts of the
software at once, since a programmer can control the development of a
specific module of code without creating problems for other
programmers working on other modules. It is notable that one of the
major improvements in Linux release 2.0 was moving from a monolithic
kernel to one made up on independently loadable modules. The
advantage, according to Torvalds, was that &quot;programmers could
work on different modules without risk of interference &hellip;
managing people and managing code led to the same design decision. To
keep the number of people working on Linux coordinated, we needed
something like kernel modules.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote133anc" HREF="#sdfootnote133sym"><SUP>133</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>&quot;.

downloaded at any stage of its development and alpha and beta
versions, that is to say incomplete or not fully tested early
versions, are built and made available to prospective users at
frequent and regular intervals, typically daily. This &ldquo;Release
Early, Release Often&rdquo; pattern is widely considered as a key
advantage of open source vs. commercial software as, by maximising
users&rsquo; feedback, it leads to a faster and more responsive
development process:</P>

<FONT SIZE=2>User-developers need to see and work with iterations of
software code in order to leverage their debugging potential.
Commercial software developers understand just as well as do open
source developers that users are often the best testers, so the
principle of release early release often makes sense in that setting
as well. The countervailing force in the commercial setting are
expectations: customers who are paying a great deal of money for
software may not like buggy beta releases, and may like even less the
process of updating or installing new releases on a frequent basis.
Open source user-developers have a very different set of
expectations. In this setting, bugs are more an opportunity and less
a nuisance. Working with new releases is more an experiment and less
a burden. The result is that open source projects typically have a
feedback and update cycle that is an order of magnitude faster than
commercial projects. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote136anc" HREF="#sdfootnote136sym"><SUP>136</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

The same pattern is applied in an even more radical way in Wikis
where there is usually no distinction between tentative and final
versions of the contents and any modification is immediately
committed and made visible to everybody. Compare this with a
traditional publishing process where the full authoring, editing,
publishing cycle can take &ndash; depending of the degree of
formality and complexity of the publication &ndash; days, months or
even years. Even longer is the time for corrections and users&rsquo;
feedback to be incorporated in subsequent versions of the product. In
the case of a typical printed encyclopedia, usually years if not
decades.</P>

The advantages of continuous integration need to be balanced with its
costs, in particular the greater burden that the process imposes on
the final user: the greatest the costs, as in the case of software
products where a mistake can have very expensive consequences, the
lower the frequency of the updates and the more likely that a clear
separation between tested and untested versions will be enforced.</P>

One of the greatest achievements of information theory is the

<FONT SIZE=2>Its most common forms: (1) repetitive transmission of
the same message over one channel, (2) duplication of channels, of
which each could handle the transmission by itself, (3) restrictions
on the use of characters or on the combinations of characters from an
alphabet to form proper words or expressions (see language), (4)
communicating something already known to its addressee. In the
process of communication redundancy is essential to combat noise, to
assure reliability and to maintain a communication channel. English
writing is estimated to be 50% redundant which accounts for the
ability of native speakers to detect and correct typing errors.
Parity checks, which are common in communication within computers,
enhance reliability but only at the expense of using additional
channel capacity. The amount of information actually transmitted is
not increased by this device. Similarly, Indian governments of the
Mogul period are known to have used at least 3 parallel reporting
channels to survey their provinces with some degree of reliability,
notwithstanding the additional efforts.<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote138anc" HREF="#sdfootnote138sym"><SUP>138</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></P>

Social knowledge applications have both the need and the means to use
redundancy. The need arises from the highly variable quality of the
inputs, that are often inconsistent or incorrect. The means are
provided by the great quantity of inputs, vastly superior to those
available to the traditional publishing industry. Redundancy is
therefore the key factor that allows knowledge integration to be
reliably performed in a large scale and uncertain environment.

Open software and open content applications are heavily reliant on

Redundancy has also been used to create large formal semantic
knowledge bases. In a recent experiment, volunteers were asked to
provide statements about simple semantic relationships among everyday
objects. For example, &ldquo;part of&rdquo; (meronymy) relationships
as in &ldquo;a wheel is <I>a part of</I> a car&rdquo;. The
correctness of the entries was later verified by an experts panel. As
the volunteers were unaware of previous entries, many statement were

the number of redundant contributions with entries that had been

To Achieve Reliability</H3>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The procedure by which reliable outputs can be produced from
unreliable but redundant inputs depends on the expected distribution
of the inputs. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
If the inputs are expected to be identical, as in the case of the
result of a mathematical calculation or the contents of a memory
location in a computer, the reliable result is the one returned by
the majority of inputs. Outliers, that is to say results that differ
from the majority, are simply thrown away. This is what happens in
fault-tolerant computing systems where every operation is performed
by more than one processor. The results are then compared in order to
identify and deactivate faulty computing units. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In the case of inputs that are supposed to be normally distributed
and independent, as it usually the case of measurements of physical
quantities, multiple results can be averaged out to produce a result
that, according to the Law of large numbers<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote142anc" HREF="#sdfootnote142sym"><SUP>142</SUP></A></SUP>,
will be progressively closer to the real value as the number of
inputs increases. Outliers, that in this case would denote values
that are at an excessive distance from the centre of the
distribution, would also be discarded. The result of the averaging
will often be closer to the true value than even the best individual
assessments <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote143anc" HREF="#sdfootnote143sym"><SUP>143</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
There are also cases where the expected distribution of inputs is
bi-modal or even multi-modal. Consider for example an encyclopedic
entry on a controversial political figure such as President W. Bush
or Osama Bin Laden. Opinions will differ widely and it is not
possible in general to establish a &lsquo;correct&rsquo; value. In
these cases, we need to break down the distribution in its
components, cluster the inputs and then average out the clusters
separately. Wikipedia&rsquo;s neutral point of view policy<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote144anc" HREF="#sdfootnote144sym"><SUP>144</SUP></A></SUP>
can be conceived as a procedure to perform precisely this operation,
preserving the different point of views of the main clusters of
public opinion on certain subjects. Collaborative filtering systems,
such as Amazon&rsquo;s recommendation system, also operate on the
base of this principle. They first connect the current user to a
cluster of similarly minded people and then produce recommendations
on the base of the cluster&rsquo;s preferences.

In information markets, traders exchange assets whose payoffs depends
on the truth value of statements whose value is currently unknown but
that can be ascertained at some time in the future. In simpler terms,
information markets trade in predictions. Examples of predictions

In the simplest kind of information market, the assets being
exchanged are contracts that give their owners the right to receive a
payment if a certain statement is eventually found to be true or
nothing otherwise. An example would be a contract stating: &ldquo;Pays

take place, as assessed by the market. If, for example, the contract
value is &euro;0.20 (assuming, as in previous example, a payoff of &euro;1

be readily demonstrated. Say that <B>p</B> is the probability that a
trader assigns to the event taking place and that <B>&pi;</B> is the

found to be unbiased on average. These were traders who made offers

Selling sushi should be a relatively straightforward business. Even
people who have never seen it before would quickly agree that sushi
tastes good, it is nutritious and it pleases the eye. Selling it
should be mostly a matter of advertising well so that an ever
increasing number of people get to appreciate its qualities.</P>

Now, what about the telephone?  Imagine approaching your first
customer and explaining how, by using a telephone, he would be able
to easily communicate with &hellip; ahem, whom exactly? Being your
first potential customer, there is nobody else that owns a phone and
therefore nobody else for him to call. At this stage, the telephone
is just as useful as a brick. Sounds like a very tough sale. On the
other hand, now that the telephone has been widely adopted, selling
telephones does not seem to be difficult at all with hundreds of
millions sold every year.

Clearly sushi and the telephone behave in a very different way. Sushi
is a product that gets easily adopted and, presumably, experience
steady and linear growth. The telephone, on the contrary, has a very
slow take off followed by a surprisingly rapid and extensive uptake.
And what it is true of the telephone applies also to many other
communication technologies, including the telegraph, computers,
paging systems and mobile phones  and the Wold Wide Web:</P>

<FONT SIZE=2>In 1844, Samuel Morse couldn&rsquo;t convince a
skeptical US Congress to fund long distance lines, as the new
communication system was seen by lawmakers more as a curiosity than
as a powerful communication medium.  By the time the first
transatlantic cable was laid in 1858, the situation had ascended to
the opposite extreme, with the press and influential figures openly
declaring that the telegraph would embrace the whole world, bringing
with it peace and prosperity&hellip;Thomas Watson, Sr., Chairman of
IBM from 1914 to 1956, is credited with having said in 1943 that
there might be a world market for around five computers. In 1960,
Motorola had created a paging system that it believed was
revolutionary, but it struggled for years to convince the regional
phone companies to buy paging equipment as well as to convince the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allocate spectrum for
paging networks. Motorola had the same experience with the creation
of cellular networks. After successfully testing a portable cellular
system in 1973, the company had to wait until 1983 for regulators to
award the first cellular operator license. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote155anc" HREF="#sdfootnote155sym"><SUP>155</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

To better understand these two different components of the total
utility of a good, let&rsquo;s start by observing that goods can
often be combined with other goods to produce composite goods or
services. When two telephones are connected through a telephone
switchboard, they produce a valuable service that could not be
produced by a telephone on its own: a communication channel. When a
music CD is inserted in a CD player connected to a loudspeaker, the
combination of these three elements produce a new good that could not
be produced by each of these elements in isolation: loud music. Goods
that can be combined to produce a composite good without additional
expense are said to be compatible<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote158anc" HREF="#sdfootnote158sym"><SUP>158</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>
and a set of compatible goods is said to constitute a network. The
elements that constitute a network, in our case economic goods, are
also known as vertices or nodes.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In many networks, the nodes combine by communicating, that is to say
by exchanging information. But communication is not the only way by
which elements can be combined. So, for example, a set of Lego blocks
is still a network, even if Lego blocks do not exchange any kind of
message, because Lego blocks can be mechanically matched to create
more complex shapes that have an entertainment value. Similarly,
languages can be seen as networks as they are collections of elements
(words) that can be combined to create valuable composites (phrases,
sentences and complete texts<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote159anc" HREF="#sdfootnote159sym"><SUP>159</SUP></A></SUP>).
They are not, however, in themselves, a communication network &ndash;
even if languages are naturally essential for any form of
communication &ndash; as words do not communicate with each other. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Naturally, composite goods can also enter into further combinations.
If we combine multiple telephone channels we get an even more
valuable good, a teleconference. If we combine loud music with a
dancing floor we have a dancing party. So the economic network is
actually multilayered with goods at each layer being both a
combination of simpler goods and a building block for more complex
goods higher up in the hierarchy. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
We can now see intrinsic and extrinsic utility as products of the
same combinatorial mechanism. The intrinsic utility of a good is the
utility produced by the combination of lower-level goods that created
the good itself. The extrinsic utility is the additional utility that
can be produced by further combinations of the good with compatible
goods to create higher-level goods.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic utility is important
because it affects how the value of a good changes in time. The
intrinsic utility of a good is a fairly stable and
context-independent quantity while the extrinsic utility can be
dramatically affected by changes in the number and nature of
compatible goods. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
An extreme example of these swift variations in value is a lottery
ticket. The intrinsic utility of the ticket, as a little printed
piece of paper, is negligible. The ticket utility is entirely
extrinsic and it is given by the possibility that the number on it
might match the number extracted in the lottery in order to create a
highly valuable composite good: the legal right to collect the
lottery price. When the lottery is over, and therefore the
&lsquo;combinational potential&rsquo; of the ticket disappears, the
ticket is left only with its insignificant intrinsic utility and
probably discarded.</P>

In principle, economic networks can be quite complex, potentially
involving goods of many different kinds combining in a variety of

If a good exclusively or preferentially combine with similar goods

The strength and direction of the network effect varies widely for
different goods, it can either increase or decrease the value of the

examples:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Let&rsquo;s start
	with sushi. Does the utility of sushi for consumers increase if the
	consumption of sushi increases? Not really. If I am a sushi lover it
	is because I enjoy its taste, not because my neighbour eats it as
	well. Similarly if I am a sushi hater. The utility of sushi is a
	fixed quantity, it does not significantly vary depending of the
	total level of sushi consumption. This is the case of most of the
	physical goods that we utilise in our daily life.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Tickets of a lottery

	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Human languages, on
	the contrary, have an increasing extrinsic value: clearly the more
	people know and use a language and the more useful the language
	becomes. This explains, for example, why there are many more people
	trying to learn English rather than, say, Croatian. The effort
	needed to learn Croatian or English, as well as their intrinsic
	utility as communication media, is roughly the same. The huge
	difference in the number of students of English language vs.
	students of Croatian is entirely due to the difference in its

	decrease. The more cars on the street and the less valuable my own
	car becomes as I will find increasingly difficult to drive around
	and find parking. Therefore, cars <SPAN LANG="en">have an increasing

	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Something similar

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
A broadcasting network is composed by a limited number of emitters
(broadcasters) that distribute information to a high number of
receivers (users). Information flows in one direction only: from the
emitters to the receivers. As broadcasting networks are, by their
very nature, asymmetric we need to distinguish between the utility
that the network has for the broadcasters (the emitters) and the
utility that the network has for the end users (the receivers).</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Let&rsquo;s start to consider the network from the point of view of a
broadcaster. Using the network, the broadcaster can potentially
connect to any of the network users. These connections have a value
as they can be either sold to the users themselves, in the form of a
channel subscription fee, or to advertisers. If we assume that each
user has the same value for the broadcaster, then the extrinsic
utility of the network for a single broadcaster is proportional to
the number of end users:</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Now,
what happens if an additional broadcaster appears on the network?
Sarnoff&rsquo;s Law would still hold, the value of the network for
the new broadcaster would still be proportional to the number of
users, but the proportionality factor (K) would likely be lowered for
both broadcasters. After all, it is unreasonable to suppose that
there is no limit to the value that additional broadcasters can
extract from a fixed user base. People have only so much time to
dedicate to broadcasts and, even more importantly, only so much money
to spend on advertised products and broadcaster&rsquo;s subscription
fees. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">So
what happens? Let us switch to the user point of view and see if that
can help clarify things. Clearly, the appearance of new broadcasters
does increase the value that the network has for the end user. Say,
for example, that a user is interested in both sport and news but
initially there are only news channels available on TV. When a new
broadcaster of sport programs appears, the TV network will have more
value for the user and broadcasters will consequently be able to
extract more value, for example in the form of an additional
subscription, than previously possible. The appearance of additional
channels will not further improve the situation though, as our
hypothetical user is already satisfied by the existing offering.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">So, an
increase in the number of broadcasters leads to an increase in the
end users utility but the additional gain obtained by adding new
broadcasters quickly declines. As a rule of thumb, we can suppose
that the utility is proportional to <B>log (B+1)</B><SUP><B><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote165anc" HREF="#sdfootnote165sym"><SUP>165</SUP></A></B></SUP>.

As broadcasters cannot extract from the end users more value than the

every adult can vote, or to advertise low-cost items that are widely
and uniformly consumed. Not so to advertise high-value items such as
luxury cars or to sell expensive channel subscriptions that are
accessible only to a minority. If we assume that the most valuable
users join the network sooner and that their value decreases
according to the same logarithmic function that we have previously

As the total utility depends on both the number of broadcasters and
the number of users, this suggests a question: what is the optimal
ratio, the one that optimises the value that users or broadcasters
can extract from the network? The question becomes particularly
interesting if we assume that the number of broadcasters and end
users are inversely correlated (so that an increase in the number of
broadcasters results in less users and vice versa). This is likely to
be the case as there are clearly costs associated with both starting
new broadcasting channels as well as in enrolling new users. For
example,  a broadcasting corporation might use its budget to either
start a new TV channel, radio station or Web site or to extend its
chain of terrestrial repeaters so that more people can access its
existing programs. The ratio between broadcasters and end users in a
broadcasting network can, at least in theory, vary widely: from a
network with a single broadcaster and many users (as it was often the
case in the past in many countries where TV and radio broadcasting
were state monopolies) to a network with many broadcasters and a
single users (for which it seems harder to find concrete examples).</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
From the point of view of a single user, the optimal network is
clearly that with the greatest number of  broadcasters, though the
marginal utility of adding more quickly diminishes:</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The situation is quite different, though, if we consider the social
value of the network, that is to say the aggregated value of the
network for all users. In this case the value is:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<B>E<SUB>users</SUB>(N,B)  = Y * N  * log(B+1)  </B>

As <B>N</B> grows faster than <B>log(B+1), </B>adding new users will
generally more valuable than adding new channels. So the social value
will be optimised by universal access. This does not take in account
the cost of adding new users (and broadcasting channels). Adding new
users is likely to be increasingly more expensive, making the optimal
value somewhat less than universal access.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
There is therefore a conflict between the interest of the users who
can already receive the broadcasts and the collective interest. So,
for example, city dwellers have nothing to gain from having people in
the countryside get TV reception, they would much rather see the cash
spent on additional channels, while it would be socially more
valuable to do precisely the opposite: bring TV to the areas that do
not receive it rather than add new channels.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
What is the situation from the point of view of the broadcasters?
That depends on our assumptions on the marginal utility of end users.
If users are all equally valuable the utility of the network for a
single broadcaster and for all broadcasters, as we have seen is:</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
In both cases, the value of the network for broadcasters increases
faster by adding new users rather than new channels.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The situation changes if, on the contrary, we assume that the
marginal utility of users for broadcaster diminishes, in this case we
would have:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">

In this case, there will be a point where adding new channels will
bring more benefit than adding new users. Broadcasters will prefer to
extract more value from their existing users by introducing a new
thematic channel or developing a more customisable interface for
their Web sites rather than investing in further expanding their user
base.

law: that all potential connections are equally valuable. They argue
that, just as for any other resource, communication has a decreasing
marginal utility. Adding more network end points is less and less
useful as the size of the network increases. There are a number of
reasons why this is likely to be the case, in both broadcasting and
many-to-many networks:</P>
<UL>
	<LI VALUE=1><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">More
	&lsquo;objectively&rsquo; valuable network resources tend to appear

	major generic channels, that are of interest to most people, are
	likely to start broadcasting sooner than more specialised channels
	that cater for small minorities.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">More &lsquo;subjectively&rsquo;
	valuable resources also tend to appear sooner. The value that a
	resource (a Web site, or a person) has for a user largely depends on
	how closely it matches the user&rsquo;s profile. If, for example,
	you are getting your first telephone number or Internet connection,
	chances are that the people that you are more likely to be
	interested in communicating with (people from the same background,
	company, geographical area, etc.) are doing the same thing at
	roughly the same time. People who join the network later are likely
	to be less closely related and therefore less valuable to you as
	they probably come from different countries, social classes or
	organisations. 
	</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The marginal utility
	of most resources decreases with consumption. If you are hungry, for
	example, a slice of bread has great utility but, as you become
	sated, the utility of additional slices quickly diminishes.
	Similarly, the first Web sites or TV channels to appear on a network
	provide great utility but the utility of subsequent sites and
	channels will be reduced as it becomes progressively difficult to
	provide unique content and users&rsquo; capacity to absorb and
	exploit information reaches its natural limits.</P>

In the previous brief analysis of broadcasting and many-to-many
networks we have made the implicit assumption that only dyadic
communication channels were possible: either between a broadcaster
and an end user or between two users. In principle, however, more
complex combinations are possible, involving many more than two
elements.  In 1999, David Reed made precisely this observation,
noticing that networks like the Internet are used not only to
broadcast information (1-to-many networks) or for users to
communicate with each other (many-to-many networks) but also to form

<FONT SIZE=2>In networks like the Internet, Group Forming Networks
(GFNs) are an important additional kind of network capability. A GFN
has functionality that directly enables and supports affiliations
(such as interest groups, clubs, meetings, communities) among subsets
of its customers. Group tools and technologies (also called community
tools) such as user-defined mailing lists, chat rooms, discussion
groups, buddy lists, team rooms, trading rooms, user groups, market
makers, and auction hosts, all have a common theme &mdash; they allow
small or large groups of network users to coalesce and to organize
their communications around a common interest, issue, or goal. Sadly,
the traditional telephone and broadcast/cable network frameworks
provide no support for groups. What I found that's surprising and
important is that GFNs create a new kind of connectivity value that
scales exponentially with <B>N</B>. Briefly, the number of
non-trivial subsets that can be formed from a set of <B>N</B> members
is <B>2<SUP>N</SUP>-N-1</B>, which grows as <B>2<SUP>N</SUP></B>.

While there is no doubt that recombination produces value, what is

the exact quantity of this value. In particular, it is not certain,

A simple counter example comes from Modern Portfolio Theory. The
theory states how rational investors can reduce investment risks by
using diversification. The basic idea is that, by combining more
assets, that are not perfectly correlated, it is possible to create
portfolios (a weighted combination of assets) that offers the same
expected return of an average share but with lower volatility. The
number of possible portfolios grows very quickly with the number of
assets. Actually, as you can combine assets in different proportions
it grows even faster than <B>2<SUP>N</SUP></B> (with <B>N</B> being
the number of assets). But what is the actual utility provided by all
these possible portfolios? In this context, utility means risk
reduction. The risk of a portfolio is given by its standard deviation
so what we want to measure is how standard deviation decreases when
more assets are combined. As we can see in the following diagram the
reduction in the standard deviation that can be obtained by
diversifications quickly tapers out. After 20 assets or so, further
improvement is almost non-existent:</P>

In itself, this example does not tell us anything about the utility
generated but social groups. It is, indeed, hard to find data that
might. Simple common sense observations, however, are sufficient to
suggest that the growth in value cannot be as rapid as Reed expects.
Let&rsquo;s consider a typical social grouping such as a commercial
company. Certainly having more people in a company adds value, as
more ideas, more knowledge and more workforce is made available. If
the value of the organisation were to grow by <B>2<SUP>N </SUP></B>,
though, adding a new member should make the organisation twice as
valuable. But would we expect, for example, the value of General
Motors to double when a new worker is added to its 317.000 strong
work force? Or the value of the English language to double when a new
word is invented?

When a new network good is made available it has no user base. Not
having users, its utility is also very low or non existent. However,
as the good has an adoption cost &ndash; that includes both its
price, if any, as well as any other expense, such as training,
required to integrate the product into the user&rsquo;s workflow &ndash;
there is no incentive for anyone to adopt it as its cost would be
necessarily greater than its non existing utility. So, even if the
good might be viable, in the sense that there are positive value of
consumption for which it would produce both consumers and producers
surpluses, the good can never reach these levels and will therefore
never be produced.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The problem is represented in the following graph. The function in

when the number of units in the network (users and/or content,
depending on the nature of the network)  is zero and it increases
rapidly when the number of units increases till it starts reaching
saturation point. The region in red is the one for which the good&rsquo;s
value is inferior to its cost and therefore consumption will not take
place. The system has two attractors: zero and its saturation point.
When the system is in the red region it will tend to lose users till
none is left. When on the right of it, consumption will grow till
saturation. The number of users for which the system pass from one
attractor to the other is the critical mass or &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo;

the following diagram, as more users join the network the marginal
utility increases till a maximum when half of the population uses the

the network due to its greater popularity is overwhelmed by the

We can now use the demand curve to study how the usage of the network
evolves in time. First of all, we can see that, for the network to be
viable, its adoption cost must be less then its maximum utility, in
this example 25. Suppose now that the cost of joining the network is
equal to 16. The minimum fraction of users that would give the
network a marginal user utility of 16 would then be 20%, in
correspondence of point <B>C</B> in the diagram. If the users are
less than this fraction, say for example that the system is initially
in position <B>A</B>, then the system is not in equilibrium as there
are some users for which the network is less valuable than its cost.
These users will drop out of the network further reducing its utility
till the network has no more users. This is true for all points at
the left of the intersection <B>C</B> between the cost and the demand
curve. Therefore, <B>C</B> determines the critical mass of the
network, that is to say the minimum usage level for which the system
will be in equilibrium for a given cost. If we manage to increase the
usage of the system beyond the critical mass, say to point <B>B</B>,
we are again in a situation of disequilibrium as the utility of the
network is greater than its cost. Additional users will then join the
network till we reach point <B>D</B>, the maximum equilibrium value
for the given cost (the Pareto optimal stable network size). So, for
a given cost <B>c</B> and corresponding <B>f<SUB>c</SUB></B> and <B>f<SUB>d</SUB></B>,
respectively critical mass and maximum usage level, the system has
two attractors: (<B>0,0</B>) for all points with <B>f&lt;f<SUB>c</SUB></B>,
and (<B>f<SUB>d</SUB>,c</B>) for all points with <B>f&gt;f<SUB>c</SUB></B>

<B>f=f<SUB>c</SUB></B>).</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
So in conclusion, network goods have a bootstrapping problem as
initially they lack the critical mass that is required to get them
growing. Once they have reached critical mass, they will grow quickly
till they reach their maximum equilibrium point. The higher the
adoption cost, or the lower the capacity of the users to exploit the
network value, the higher the critical mass that will be required to
get the network started and the lower the final number of network
users.</P>

The bootstrapping problem plagues all networks and, as networks are
everywhere, it appears in the most unlikely contexts. Have you, for
instance, ever tried to learn a foreign language? And failed? A
language, as we have mentioned before, is also a network. The value
of a language derives from the fact that its words can be combined to
form meaningful utterances. If we think of words as elements of a
network we can use the previous analysis to explain why learning a
new language is such a hard job and why therefore most people will
fail at it (I should know, having tried, and eventually failed, to
learn at least four or five different languages). Every time we learn
a new word our language network increases. The value of a word
depends on two factors: its capacity of being combined with other
words (<B>w<SUB>u</SUB></B>) to produce useful meanings and on how
many other words we already now (<B>f</B>). Just as in the previous
model, we can assume that we will start by learning the words with
the highest recombination potential (highest <B>w<SUB>u</SUB></B>)
and that such potential progressively decreases as we move from the
most common to the most specific and infrequently used words.
Learning a new word has a cost (<B>c</B>), that we can assume to be
constant. Learning a new language is therefore akin to getting a
network started and is subject to the usual bootstrapping problem:
given a certain average cost in adding a new word to our vocabulary,
there is a critical mass of words that have to be learned before the
cost of learning the language starts being paid back by the utility
that we get from it. Languages are therefore not the kind of thing
that you can learn just a little bit of. Learning a few words is more
a pain than it is worth, in the very precise sense that the learning
cost is higher than the resulting utility, and if you fail to put
together the required critical mass of words your knowledge will
start to unravel just like a network being fled by its users. If, on
the contrary, you manage to reach the critical mass you will be in a
completely different regime where learning new words is more than
worth the effort. You will then continue learning till you reach your
optimal equilibrium level. This final level is, again, dependent on
the learning cost. So, for example, despite having spent much more
time in England than in France, my French vocabulary is still more
extensive than my English one as the average cost of learning new
French words &ndash; that, as for my native Italian vocabulary, are
mostly derived from Latin &ndash; is, for me, much lower than
learning new English words, with their unfamiliar Germanic roots.

What can be done to solve the bootstrapping problem? If we look at
the demand curve, we see that there are only two ways to reduce the
critical mass: either decrease the adoption cost or increase the
capacity of exploiting the network value. These efforts can never be
totally successful, however, as costs cannot be completely eliminated
and the network utility function cannot be infinitely steep. There
will always be a residual critical mass that will need to be provided
to get the network started. The <A HREF="#hn24">Bootstrapping</A> and

One of the most striking aspects of networks is that, in many cases,
there is only one of a kind. There is a single world-wide telephone

system to publish documents online (the World Wide Web). The
functions performed by these systems could have been performed just
as well by networks based on different technologies and standards.

resisted interconnection for a long time. For example, a century ago
in the U.S., the Bell System and the independent phone companies

interconnection was achieved (through a combination of financial
maneuvers and political pressure), but it took two decades. In the
late 1980s and early 1990s, the commercial online companies such as
CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, and MCIMail, provided email to subscribers,
but only within their own systems, and it was only in the mid-1990s
that full interconnection was achieved. More recently yet, AOL for
many years resisted interconnecting its IM system with those of its
competitors, and it is only in 2004 that an agreement, at least in
principle, was reached to carry this out. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote176anc" HREF="#sdfootnote176sym"><SUP>176</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

The long term tendency of networks to interconnect and merge in
bigger networks can be explained by observing that, if the utility of
a network increases more than linearly with the number of users (or,

<FONT SIZE=2>Let us assume that Metcalfe's Law holds, and we have two
ISPs, call them A and B, with <B>m</B> and <B>n</B> customers,
respectively, and that on average the customers are comparable. Then
interconnection would provide each of the <B>m</B> customers of A
with additional value <B>n</B> (assuming the constant of
proportionality in Metcalfe's Law is 1), or a total added value of <B>mn</B>
for all the customers of A. Similarly, each member of B would gain <B>m</B>
in value, so all the customers of B would gain total value of <B>nm</B>
from interconnection. Thus aggregate gains to customers of A and B
would be equal, and the two ISPs should peer, if they are rational.
However, the incentives are different if our <B>nlog(n)</B> rule for

would increase the value of the service to A's customers by about
3,323,907, while B's customers would gain about 1,425,434. Thus the
smaller network would gain more than twice as much as the larger one.

There are cases, however, where merging is not really an option. A
good example are hardware architectures. Each hardware architecture
can be considered as a distinct network as it sets different, and
usually incompatible, rules for the interconnection of components
such as CPUs, memory and storage and communication devices. Many
hardware architectures, and in particular motherboard-level
interconnection standards and CPUs instruction sets, cannot be easily
merged or converge. And that is not for want of try, witness the
countless efforts to emulate, by hardware of software means,
alternative PC architectures, for example to run Windows/Intel

Arthur is the economist that, in the last two decades, has more than
anyone else stressed the need to develop an economic theory for
increasing returns goods. According to Arthur, classical economists

as their production cost decreases as production output increases.
What is more, their marginal manufacturing costs are essentially
independent of the complexity and therefore of the user value of the
produced good. This is not usually the case for the manufacturing of
physical goods. Producing a Ferrari is always going to be more
expensive than producing a Fiat Panda. Increased performance and
sophistication does usually reflect in higher marginal costs of
production. And this is naturally the reason why not everybody goes
around in Ferraris or BMWs. Not so for information goods. It doesn&rsquo;t
cost more to produce a new copy of a New York Times article than one
from a lesser newspaper or to produce a copy of the best software
game rather than one of the worst. But, naturally, these goods have a
very different value for their prospective users that, given the
option of acquiring them at the same price, will always opt for the
most valuable option. If Google, say, is even by a modest margin the
best search engine and it does not cost more than its rivals, the
vast majority of users will choose it, hugely amplifying the
practical consequences of what might be just a minor technical
advantage. Under the reasonable assumption that the quality of
informational goods depends on the investment made to create them, we
can say that the information economy has a built-in bias in favour of
those organisations that can afford to shoulder the greatest

<SPAN LANG="en">It is a platitude to say that the present depends on
the past. The relationship between past and present, however, is far
from plain. The way in which the past influence the future varies
widely. We can examine this relationship more closely by considering
a few examples. Take first the case of a seismograph. Earth tremors
and movements are, after a little delay, converted in movements of a
stylus that leaves a trace on a moving roll of paper. The stronger
the movement, the greater the displacement of the stylus from its
rest position. In the case of the seismograph, the final state of the
system is linearly correlated with its past. Information is
preserved, by looking at the trace left by the stylus we can see what
happened at any moment in the past. Consider now a glass that is
progressively filled with water. There are an infinite number of ways
in which this process can take place. We might pour the water in the
middle of the glass, or more on one side; we might fill it at a
continuous rate or discontinuously. Once the glass is filled,
however, the result will look pretty much the same. The system, in
converging to a simple attractor state, has &lsquo;forgotten&rsquo;
much about the details of its past. It preserves the information
regarding the total quantity of poured water but has forgotten about
the exact sequence of &ldquo;pouring events&rdquo;. Consider finally
the case of a stone in precarious equilibrium on top of a mountain. A
minor accident happens, maybe it starts raining and a rain drop hits
a stone on one side altering its equilibrium and causing it to fall
in a certain direction. If the rain drop had hit the stone on a
different point, the stone would have fallen in a different direction
and it might have ended in a completely different place. A minor
accidental variation in the past has been hugely amplified leading to
completely different final state. </SPAN>A random fluctuation in a
critical moment of the system history has given rise to a stable
feature. If the fluctuation is so small to be imperceptible to an

in the United States. The fact that relatively minor accidents were
able to lead to much greater consequences indicates that the
underlying systems were in an unstable state. The important question
is if the system could have evolved in different directions. If the
unstable equilibrium point was encircled by the attraction basin of a
single attractor, or in other words if the system could evolve only
in a single direction, the specific nature of the accident is of
little consequence, only its timing has any importance. If, on the

Arthur proposes a simple model that shows how technological lock-in

This payoff structure makes so that R agents will choose technology A

adoption of the two technologies becomes too unfavourable to their
preferred choice. At every time step, either an agent of type R or
type S enters the market and makes its choice. The situation is
represented in the following diagram where axis Y is the difference
in adoption between the two technologies and axis X is the time.

that random factors, such as the particular order in which agents

the outcome. What is worrying in this scenario is that, if the choice

<FONT SIZE=2><SPAN LANG="en">There are three possible efficiency
outcomes where a dynamic process exhibits sensitive dependence on
initial conditions. First, this sensitivity might do no harm. That is
to say, initial actions, perhaps insignificant ones, do put us on a
path that cannot be left without some cost, but that path happens to
be optimal (although not necessarily uniquely optimal). For example,
a capricious decision to part one's hair on the left may lead to a
lifetime of left-side parting, but the initial urge to part on the
left might capture all there is to be taken into account &hellip; We
will call instances in which sensitivity to starting points exists,
but with no implied inefficiency first-degree path dependence. Where
information is imperfect, a second possibility arises. Where this is
the case, it is possible that efficient decisions may not always
appear to be efficient in retrospect. Here the inferiority of a
chosen path is unknowable at the time a choice was made, but we later
recognize that some alternative path would have yielded greater
wealth. In such a situation, which we will call second-degree path
dependence, sensitive dependence on initial conditions leads to
outcomes that are regrettable and costly to change. They are not,
however, inefficient in any meaningful sense, given the assumed
limitations on knowledge. Related to this second type of path
dependence is third-degree path dependence. In third-degree path
dependence, sensitive dependence on initial conditions leads to an
outcome that is inefficient &ndash; but in this case the outcome is
also &quot;remediable.&quot; That is, there exists or existed some
feasible arrangement for recognizing and achieving a preferred
outcome, but that outcome is not obtained. </SPAN><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote189anc" HREF="#sdfootnote189sym"><SUP>189</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

third-degree path dependence that has actually lead to persistently

examples of products that have become de facto standards even if they

managed to obliterate. Some of the most commonly cited are the VHS

Microsoft&rsquo;s Disk Operating System as the default PC operating
system. When the IBM PC was released three operating systems where

Consider now the decision that end users and software companies were
facing at the time. We can model this as a game between each agent
and the market as a whole where there are three optimal choices (Nash
equilibria) corresponding to the agent making the same choice as the
market. But how would the agents know what the market choice would
be? The agents might have looked at the intrinsic value of the
available choices and they might have agreed, in their majority, that
one of the option was technically preferable. Most likely this would
have been CP/M-86,  a derivation of CP/M, a mature and well regarded
operating system. Unfortunately, technical brilliance was not the
only consideration. They also had to take in account the extrinsic
value of the available options. In other terms, they had to estimate
which option was most likely to be successful and would therefore
have enjoyed the advantages of greater software availability and a
larger user base. Now, Microsoft&rsquo;s DOS was promoted by IBM as
the default choice, with the others available as an extra-cost
option. The initial decision of IBM to put its weight behind one of
these options altered the situation. Everybody knew that everybody
would eventually have gone for the most popular option and everybody
thought that, given IBM support, the option most likely to be would
have been MS-DOS. So, though on purely technical grounds, most people
might have preferred CP/M, the less intrinsically valuable MS-DOS
ended to prevail. In itself, this is just a coordination failure,
but, if we add to this that, as it was suggested at the time, the
choice of IBM to back up Microsoft was quite accidental<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote192anc" HREF="#sdfootnote192sym"><SUP>192</SUP></A></SUP>,
we then might have an example of third-degree path dependence.

There are two important factors, however, that significantly reduce
the practical importance of lock-in by path-dependence. First of all,
even in Arthur&rsquo;s model of technology choice, the best
technology is still more likely to succeed. If the agents&rsquo;
initial preference for one of the technologies is greater than for
the alternative, the difference in adoption between the two
technologies that is required to make the less preferred technology
the best choice will be greater than the corresponding difference
required for the preferred technology. Given that the probability of
a random walk to cover a given distance is proportional to the square
root of the number of time steps, even a modest difference in
relative preference would significantly boost the chances of the
random walk to lead to the correct choice. Secondly, technologies are
not static, they evolve and improve &ndash; indeed Arthur stresses
that this is one of the main reasons that they display increasing
returns &ndash; and in their progress initial differences are likely
to be overcome. This is especially true for software technologies
whose potential for improvement is essentially unbound. As an
example, the, originally much derided, MS-DOS has evolved into a line
of very sophisticated operating systems that offer all the features
of, previously superior, alternatives. So, in the long run, even an
initial incorrect choice can be of no major consequence.

In conclusions, there are some theoretical reasons that lead to
believe that path dependence might play a role in increasing returns
goods, and therefore in network, adoption. The practical importance
of random fluctuations in determining technology lock-in and other
persistent features is much harder to ascertain and is probably
rather modest and overshadowed by more substantive elements such as
time-to-market, adoption costs and availability of start-up capital
to promote and &lsquo;seed&rsquo; the network.</P>

It is not just external observers, that might be excused for not
fully understanding radically new technologies, but sometime also the
very inventors and key companies that create and commercialise
network technologies that fail to appreciate their full potential. An
interesting example is that of the long distance telephone system. An
idea of Theodore Vail, the first General Manager of the Bell Company,
that was met with widespread hostility inside his own company, the
very same company that had invented and successfully commercialised
the telephone as a revolutionary medium for short-distance,
city-wide, communication:</P>

captains: &quot;Tell our agents that we have a proposition on foot to
connect the different cities for the purpose of personal
communication, and in other ways to organize a GRAND TELEPHONIC
SYSTEM.&quot;&hellip; He resolved to build a line from Boston to
Providence, and was so stubbornly bent upon doing this that when the
Bell Company refused to act, he picked up the risk and set off with
it alone. He organized a company of well known Rhode
Islanders&ndash;nicknamed the &quot;Governors' Company&quot;&ndash;and
built the line. It was a failure at first, and went by the name of
&quot;Vail's Folly.&quot;.. [eventually] the Bell Company came over
to Vail's point of view, bought his new line, and launched out upon
what seemed to be the foolhardy enterprise of stringing a double wire
from Boston to New York&hellip;There was much opposition to such
extravagance, and much ridicule. &quot;I wouldn't take that line as a

And it was not just a few short-sighted company officials that got it
wrong. Vail himself, though well beyond his time in proposing the

what we now take for granted: direct home-to-home long distance phone
connections. To foster the development of long distance telephony,
Vail created the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (AT&amp;T)
company. His plan for AT&amp;T seems to have been modelled around the
only existing long-distance communication network of the time, the

videotext terminals had been installed, some forecasters were
predicting that there would be 1.9 million videotext users by 1988.
One year later, in 1984, the forecast was adjusted downward to 95,000

forecast for 2000 Internet advertising revenues across five analysis
firms was $3.6 billion &hellip; The actual amount spent on online
advertising in 2000 was $8.1 billion, which was more than double the
average forecast for 2000. The ratio of actual Internet advertising
revenues to predicted revenues grew steadily from 5% in 1996 to a
whopping 225% in 2000. But by 2000, Internet hype had reached a
crescendo, and the forecasters had changed their tune. The forecasts
made in 2000 started to look highly optimistic, with the average
estimate of 2003 Internet advertising revenues across two forecasts
climbing to a whopping $24.85 billion. The actual 2003 revenues were
a mere $7.3 billion, almost a third of the estimate! The forecasts
became increasingly optimistic over time, with the ratio of actual to
predicted revenues falling steadily from 107% in 2000 to 39% in 2003.
This is a clear illustration of the &ldquo;swinging pendulum&rdquo;

Sawhney <I>et al.</I> propose two different explanations for this
forecasting bias. The first applies only to the excessive optimism
phase: forecasters, dazzled by the initial success of network
technologies, fail to realise that before they can reach their full
potential they need a series of parallel advancement in other
sectors. If these are not forthcoming, the development of the new
network will be slowed down invalidating the optimistic forecasts.
For example, railways, given the unprecedented geographical extension
of their assets and the distributed nature of their organisations,
required major managerial and technological advancements. One of
these advancements was the electrical telegraph, a network technology
that appeared only 20 years after the railway. The telegraph was
immediately adopted by the railway operators, the first commercial
telegraph line was located along a tract of the U.K. Great Western
Railway in 1839<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote199anc" HREF="#sdfootnote199sym"><SUP>199</SUP></A></SUP>,

assessment and the following optimistic ones. It points to a
different kind of cognitive limitation of humans forecasters, and in
particular the fact that we tend to &ldquo;extrapolate the future as

projection might be justified on the base of its inherent simplicity

As the adoption curve of a network good is a logistic, applying a
linear approximation leads to under prediction in the early phases of
development, when the uptake of the network is slowed down by the
lack of consumption, and over prediction in the later exponential

Observer&rsquo;s biases and cognitive limitations are not the only
possible cause of incorrect forecasts. Network systems can be, in
some circumstances, inherently unpredictable. Networks, as many other
dynamic non-linear systems, can be highly sensitive to initial
conditions. High sensitivity means that the system, starting from two
different but very close, up to the point of being undistinguishable,
initial states can evolve in very different ways. As it is impossible
to measure with absolute precision the state of a system, the
long-term behaviour of systems that are highly sensitive to initial
conditions can be unpredictable. When a N-to-N network is in
proximity of its critical mass (see <A HREF="#hn65">Networks Have a
Bootstrapping Problem</A>), accidental factors and small random
fluctuations, that cannot be forecast or measured, might push the
system either toward success or extinction. A similar problem arises
when there are two or more competing networks (see <A HREF="#hn69">Network
Evolution is Path Dependent</A>). If the networks have similar market
shares (or, more precisely, similar extrinsic value), it might be
impossible to predict which network will eventually prevail. The
system constituted by all the competing networks is very sensitive to
initial conditions as small random fluctuations in the networks
relative market shares get quickly amplified, with the more popular
network growing faster than the others.

Whatever their cause, forecasting errors regarding the adoption of
network technologies are a cause of serious concern, as they lead to
poor investment decisions. Resources are allocated by markets or
private investors on the base of the expected future stream of
revenue of different investment options. If the future prospects of
network goods are initially under predicted this leads to
underinvestment. This is particularly problematic for budding
networks as, not only it slows down their adoption, but it might also
prove lethal.  Networks, by their very nature, have a bootstrapping
problem that can be overcome only by an initial investment.
Underinvestment in the initial stage compounds this problem and make
it harder for the network to reach the critical mass of users that it
needs to survive. At a later stage, irrational optimism leads to
overinvestment and consequent investors&rsquo; losses as we have seen

In the previous sections, we have examined some of the surprising
aspects of network goods economic behaviour and noticed how, under
some conditions, they might lead to economically inefficient
outcomes.  Given the growing importance that network goods have in
our economy this is a critical and widely debated issue. In this

and examine some of the possible solutions.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
As we have seen, the key feature of network goods, from an economic
point of view, is that a significant part of their utility does not
derive by their intrinsic characteristics but rather from the fact
that the elements that compose them can be recombined, by
communication or other means, to create valuable composite goods and
services. We have therefore distinguished between intrinsic and
extrinsic utility and seen how extrinsic utility grows with the size
of the network in different kinds of network topologies.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Utility, however, is only a part of the picture. What economic agents
are really concerned about is surplus, that is to say the gain that
they can make by engaging in a given economic transaction. Clearly,
for a transaction to take place at all, we need to have at least two
agents: one that produces a good and another who consumes it.
Consequently, we have two forms of surplus: producer surplus and
consumer surplus. Producer surplus is the difference between the
market price of a good and the cost of producing it. Consumer surplus
is the difference between the utility that the good has for a
consumer, or in other terms the maximum price that the consumer would
be willing to pay for it, and the good market price. If producers and
consumers are rational, they will act in a way that maximises their
respective surpluses.</P>

Consider what happens if, as shown in the previous diagram, the price
is set too high, at P<SUB>1,</SUB> so that the quantity supplied Q<SUB>s</SUB>
is higher than the quantity demanded Q<SUB>d</SUB>. To get rid of the
surplus production, producers will have to reduce the price till it
reaches P, where supply meets demand. Similarly, if the price were
too low and therefore supply were less than demand, producers would
find it advantageous to increase production till the price reaches
the equilibrium price. At this price neither producers or consumers
can do anything that will increase their surplus. If a producer were
to produce an additional unit of the good, it would have to sell it
under cost, if a consumer were to buy an additional unit of good it
would have to pay more than its worth. The total surplus created is
given by the area delimited by the supply and demand curves on the
left of the equilibrium price. Consumers get the part that is over
the price line, producers the part below. Given the social and
technical constrains that determine the supply and demand curves,
this is as good as it gets. The market has automatically settled in a
comfortable Pareto optimal<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote204anc" HREF="#sdfootnote204sym"><SUP>204</SUP></A></SUP>
state, a condition where it is impossible to improve someone&rsquo;s
lot without making someone else worse off. Total social surplus is
maximised and we say that the outcome is economically efficient.

Back now to our network goods. In a competitive market, network goods
should behave just as virtuously as any other good. Regrettably, a
problem arises when the extrinsic utility created by the network is
not captured, the technical term is &lsquo;internalized&rsquo;, by
the agents that take the decisions that affect the production or
consumption of the good:

<FONT SIZE=2>The difference between a network effect and a network
externality lies in whether the impact of an additional user on other

is almost always assumed to be positive in this literature, the
social utility from another network user will always be greater than
the private utility. If network effects are not internalized, the
equilibrium network size may be smaller than is efficient. For
example, if the network of telephone users were not owned, it would
likely be smaller than optimal since no agent would capture the
benefits that an additional member of the network would impose on
other members. (Alternatively, if the network effects were negative,
a congestion externality might mean that networks tend to be larger

Consider another example: the educational market. Getting an
education, even a basic one, is very expensive. As for any other
good, rational agents will acquire an education only if they can
expect to gain more than they spend on it. Having an education,
however, is an advantage not only for the educated person but also
for the society at large. Educated people bring in new ideas,
contribute to a more informed public opinion and in general make for
a more productive society<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote207anc" HREF="#sdfootnote207sym"><SUP>207</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.

they will underinvest in education so reducing global social welfare.
This is the basic reason why in most countries getting a basic
education is a legal obligation. As the educational market, left to
its own devices, would not provide a level of education that is
socially optimal, the government steps in making education cheaper,
by providing it at a subsided price, and by making truancy more

We can see in the diagram how network externalities (in this case
positive ones, but symmetrical considerations apply to the case of
negative externalities) affect the market equilibrium. If customers
cannot internalize the network effects, their demand curve will be
lower than it would otherwise be leading to lower production and
consumption. We can see how this reduces the area delimited by the
supply and demand curves on the left of the equilibrium price that,
as we have mentioned before, corresponds to the social surplus
generated by the good.</P>

The obvious solution to this problem is to extend, wherever possible,
private ownership so that it can capture, or &ldquo;internalize&rdquo;,
the network externalities. This is the normal case for networks that
have a &ldquo;physical&rdquo; component, such as the telephone
network. In the case of networks that have no physical incarnation,
such for example a software standard for information exchange, a

standard can appropriate the benefits of internalizing any network
effects. Although we do not have any evidence that inferior standards
have prevailed against superior standards, this may be in large part
because most standards are supported by companies who have some form
of ownership such as patent, copyright, or business positioning. The
greatest chance for some form of third-degree path dependence &hellip;
to arise would be if an unowned standard with dispersed adherents

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
When the World Wide Web was introduced in 1991, the idea of an
Internet-wide document publishing system was not completely new. In
particular, there was already a system known as Gopher<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote213anc" HREF="#sdfootnote213sym"><SUP>213</SUP></A></SUP>,
designed by the University of Minnesota, that offered functionality
very similar to the Web. The system enjoyed support from a number of
important companies, including IBM that had made available Gopher
compatible software, and had already gained a modest but growing user
base. What it is more, some users seemed to prefer it to the WWW. In
the recollection of the inventor of the Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
&hellip; <FONT SIZE=2>instead of using hypertext and links, it
(Gopher) presented users with menus, taking them eventually to
documents normally in plain text. I had found that some people when
they saw the Web, thought hypertext was confusing or worried that
somehow they would get lost in hyperspace when following a link. Of
course, this could happen in gopher space too, but computer users
were familiar with menus so the program didn&rsquo;t seem as foreign.

<FONT SIZE=2>In was just about this time, spring 1993, that the
University of Minnesota decided it would ask for a license fee from
certain classes of users who wanted to use gopher &hellip; The
browser, and the act of browsing, would be free, and the server
software would remain free to nonprofit and educational institutions.
But any other users, notably companies, would have to pay to use
gopher server software. This was an act of treason in the academic
community and the Internet community. Even if the university never
charged anyone a dime, the fact that the school had announced it was
reserving the right to charge people for the use of the gophers
protocols meant it had crossed the line. To use the technology was
too risky. Industry dropped gopher like a hot potato. Developers knew
they couldn&rsquo;t do anything that could possibly be said to be
related to the gopher protocol without asking all their lawyers first
about negotiating rights. Even if a company wrote its own gopher
client or server, the university could later sue for infringement of
some intellectual property right. <SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote215anc" HREF="#sdfootnote215sym"><SUP>215</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></P>

Instructed by the Gopher example, Tim Berners-Lee hurried into
getting CERN, that owned the WWW intellectual rights, to release the
Web specification and software in the public domain. The consequence
was that the Web quickly overcame Gopher as the most popular Internet
document publishing system and the gap between the two kept
increasing steadily till Gopher was completely swept aside. Though
the University of Minnesota eventually realised its mistake and
released Gopher under a GPL license, the damage was done and Gopher
is now just a footnote in the history of the Internet.</P>

A similar lesson can be derived from the history of e-mail. When
Internet e-mail became generally available, there were already a

dispersed adherents&rdquo;.

Something is clearly wrong here. Rather than directing the goose of
technology to lay the correct number of golden eggs, intellectual
property seems to be killing it instead. This is particularly
surprising given that the whole idea behind the intellectual property
(IP) system is precisely to foster innovation. To acquire a patent,
inventors need to release for public inspection the inner workings of
their inventions, providing inspiration and conceptual building
blocks for further advancement. In exchange of this disclosure,
authors and inventors get a time-limited monopoly on the commercial
exploitation of their work. The legal protection of intellectual
property provides an essential incentive for innovation and,
consequently, it has been seen, since ancient times, as one of the
major engines of economical development. The history of IP protection
in Europe dates back to at least Renaissance Italy, the Republic of
Venice started issuing patents in 1474, an international IP system
has been in place for well over a century<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote216anc" HREF="#sdfootnote216sym"><SUP>216</SUP></A></SUP>

Even in the best of circumstances network goods have a &lsquo;bootstrapping
problem&rsquo; (see <A HREF="#hn65">Networks Have a Bootstrapping
Problem</A>) as their value largely depends on how widely they are
used and users are precisely what networks inevitably lack in their
initial adoption phase. A high adoption cost is therefore a major and
possibly lethal liability for network goods, as it might make it
impossible for them to reach the &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo; where
the value of the system is greater than its cost. This is indeed what
seem to have happened to Gopher. The system was still in its infancy
and therefore had modest extrinsic utility. The announcement of
license charges made its prospective adoption cost much greater than
its current value and this, coupled with the existence of a capable
substitute in the form of the Web, was sufficient to seal its

The key difference between a monopolist producer and a producer in a
competitive market is that a monopolist has the option of deciding at
what price he will sell its goods. In order to optimise its profits,
he will set the price to the point where the marginal cost (MC in the
diagram) equals marginal revenue (MR in the diagram). If the demand
for the good does not decline quickly when the price increases<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote226anc" HREF="#sdfootnote226sym"><SUP>226</SUP></A></SUP>,
the price set by the monopolist will be higher than the one that the
market would have reached if it had been competitive, at the
intersection of the demand and marginal cost curves. The result is
not only that the monopolist gains more but, more importantly, that
total social welfare is diminished as the reduction in consumer

Another source of inefficiency is that monopolies, in absence of
credible alternatives, have little incentive to innovate. A startling
example comes from the recent history of the Web. When, in 1995,
Microsoft started developing Internet Explorer, its Web browser
technology, it had to face strong competition by Netscape, that had
made available the first industrial-strength Web browser in 1994.
Eventually though, thanks to a major investment in Web technology and
to the fact that Internet Explorer had become a standard component of
the Windows operating system, Microsoft managed to get control of the
Web browser market. In early 2002, shortly after the launch of its
sixth version, the combined market penetration of all versions of
Internet Explorer was over 85%<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote228anc" HREF="#sdfootnote228sym"><SUP>228</SUP></A></SUP>.
As an increasing number of Web sites started to make use of the
proprietary features of Internet Explorer, Microsoft&rsquo;s control
of the market grew even greater, eventually establishing a <I>de
facto</I> monopoly. In 2002, after seven years of tumultuous
development, Internet Explorer was not only by far the most popular
but, arguably, the technically most advanced Web browser. After
winning its battle with Netscape for the control of the Web browser
market, however, the incentive for further improvements disappeared
and, since 2002, Internet Explorer has not known any significant
update. The appearance in late 2004 of realistic competition from the
Firefox browser, seems to have awaken Microsoft from its complacency
and a new release of Internet Explorer is now scheduled to appear
sometime in 2006. It is hard to estimate the damage to social welfare
caused by the freezing of client-side Web technology for a period of
5 years but, given the huge economic and social impact of the Web, it
is likely to be substantial.

If monopolies are bad news even for normal goods, they have
particularly nasty consequences when applied to network goods.
Networks naturally tend to dislodge competitors and to completely
fill their market niche (see <A HREF="#hn66">One Function One
Network</A>). Private ownership of the intellectual property
underlying a network therefore inevitably leads to one or a few
commercial companies having full control of entire industry sectors.
The profits and the commercial and political leverage that network
monopolists obtain can therefore be momentous. It is not by chance if
Microsoft and Intel, that jointly own the key intellectual property
underlying one of the world largest networks, the personal computer,
are also among the most valuable and influential commercial companies
in the world.</P>

In conclusion, private ownership of the intellectual property of
networks, when it does not lead to network hara-kiri, reduces social
welfare via monopolist pricing, lack of innovation and a disturbing
concentration of economic power. If we remove IP from the picture,
however, we are still left with our original problems: how are we
going to provide the necessary incentive for inventors? And how can
we make sure that networks reach their socially optimal size? Is IP,
after all, a necessary evil? A mechanism to provide the necessary
tradeoff between promoting inventiveness and overall economic
efficiency?

<FONT SIZE=2>To the extent that information is a public good, the
efficient price for information as input is also zero. Pricing
information at above this price retards new creation, as well as

regulation-created exclusivity, new incentives to produce are created

To find a solution, we need to look again at the differences between
ordinary and network goods. Let us consider the non-network goods
first. Imagine having just invented Viagra or written the first
volume of the Harry Potter series. How could you profit from such a
remarkable invention or literary work? The only possible answer is:
by manufacturing copies of your work and selling them. And that is,

Consider now a network good such as the Web. How could you profit
from that? You could, as in the case of the non-network goods, try to
profit from it directly by selling your proprietary Web software or,
possibly, licences to use the Web protocols. Unfortunately, rather
than making you wealthy, this approach might end up destroying your
budding technology. If you somehow managed to overcome the network
bootstrapping problem, things would look decidedly up for you,

the rest of society that would have to shoulder the burden of your

interesting option. Rather than profiting directly from the network
intellectual property you might profit from it indirectly either by
selling derived products or providing related services. This is
possible because the real value of the network is not intrinsic, it
does not reside in what it is, but rather in the novel combinations
that it permits. So, it makes sense to remove any constrain to the
network growth letting it reach its full potential, even if this
means forfeiting any direct gain, and then profit from the large
market for derived products and services that the network will
generate. Naturally, as an inventor, you might not be able to
personally capture more than a modest share of the extrinsic value
created by your network. After all &ndash; apart from a knighthood, a
directorship, a professorship, a number of prices, income from sales
of a popular book and eternal fame &ndash; the inventor of the Web
has not gained much from his remarkable achievement. But a tiny share
of a very large cake is still bigger than 100% of nothing at all, as
it would have been the case if the Web had gone down the Gopher way.

So, in the case of network goods, the solution to the problem of
promoting innovation is quite different from the solution that is
appropriate for non-network goods: open standards and indirect
exploitation of the network extrinsic value vs. private ownership of
the intellectual property and exploitation of the good intrinsic
value.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
If you look at the Web, you can see this mechanism in action, the
network intellectual property is available as open standards that
anyone can exploit at no charge, and on top of those standards an
enormous online economy has developed. In the software industry, this
approach is becoming increasingly popular and it is been codified
under the name of &ldquo;professional open source&rdquo; business
model. An increasing number of companies make available their
software as open source, strive to build communities and &ldquo;economical
ecosystems&rdquo; around their products and get their income by
selling related services such as technical support, training,
customisations and extensions<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote230anc" HREF="#sdfootnote230sym"><SUP>230</SUP></A></SUP>.
Individual developers, even when they do not sell services, can also
profit indirectly by open source, as participation to a successful
open source project is a good way of signalling their superior
technical skills to prospective employers <SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote231anc" HREF="#sdfootnote231sym"><SUP>231</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>

Open standards also promote continuous innovation. On this point, it
is interesting to briefly compare the evolution of two software
networks: desktop PC operating systems and Java applications servers.
The desktop PC market is dominated by the proprietary Microsoft&rsquo;s
Windows OS. Thought both cheaper options such as the Linux operating
system and more user-friendly options such as the Apple Mac OS X have
been available for a number of years, the massive extrinsic utility
produced by the rich ecosystem that has developed around the Windows
OS, combined with the proprietary nature of Windows that make its
cloning impossible, has made Microsoft&rsquo;s position almost
unassailable. As a consequence, the pace of innovation that the vast
majority of desktop users can benefit from, is dictated and limited
by the commercial and technical policies of Microsoft. The Java
applications server market is on the contrary, based upon open
standards<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote232anc" HREF="#sdfootnote232sym"><SUP>232</SUP></A></SUP>.
Though many major commercial software companies &ndash; such as IBM,
BEA, Sun and HP &ndash; operate in this market this is not in itself
a barrier for new entrants as demonstrated by the case of JBoss<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote233anc" HREF="#sdfootnote233sym"><SUP>233</SUP></A></SUP>,
a cash-poor but technically innovative application server distributed
according to an open source business model, that in a few years has
gained a very significant market share. JBoss, and other small
application server providers, have introduced many significant
technical innovations that have been incorporated in the latest
version of the Java application servers standard. The greatest
openness of the Java application server market to innovation and
competition is not due to the lack of network effects, that are
strong, but rather on the fact that the advantages brought by these
effects are shared among all the market players giving them a
competitive edge with respect to providers of alternative less
popular technologies, but without stifling internal competition.</P>

Distributions and Preferential Attachment in Networks</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
A network can be represented as a graph: a set of nodes (or vertices)
connected by edges (or links). Now imagine starting with a set of
unconnected nodes. How would you grow a network out of it? A simple
way would be to pick up two nodes at random and connect them with an
edge and repeat this process till we get a single connected graph. A
network built this way is, unsurprisingly, known as a random network.
If now we plot the distribution of the number of edges per vertex we
get a binomial distribution (and eventually, if we keep adding edges,
a normal distribution).</P>

This is what we would expect. Given that we have added edges randomly

Random networks are &ldquo;egalitarian&rdquo;, in the sense that

more a &ldquo;hub and spoke&rdquo; system where a few key sites (e.g.
Google, Yahoo, MSN) gathers millions of links while the vast majority

The power law distribution can be explained if we assume that links
are not added randomly to the network nodes but rather in proportion
to the number of links that the nodes already have. This way, nodes
&lsquo;rich&rsquo; in links become increasingly richer with time
while the less fortunate ones grow less quickly and therefore become,
comparatively, poorer. When applied to network evolution this
mechanism is known as <I>preferential attachment</I>, a term coined

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Thought the preferential attachment model broadly explains the
power-law distribution of Web links, it fails to account for some of
its subtler features. First of all, the model predicts that there
should be a strong correlation between the age of a node and its
degree (the number of links). Nodes that join the network early have
a head start and, given preferential attachment, their advantage
should grow with time making older nodes permanently more well
connected than younger ones. Empirical evidence, however, does not
support this conclusion<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote245anc" HREF="#sdfootnote245sym"><SUP>245</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
How should the preferential attachment model be extended in order to
address these limits? To answer this question, we need to take a step
back and look more carefully at what factors motivate agents to add
new links.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">In
general, rational agents will try to maximise the net gain that they
derive from their actions, for example by acquiring a certain good.
The user surplus, that is to say the net gain that an user derives
from acquiring a certain good, is given by the difference between the
good utility and cost:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<B>S = U &ndash; C</B></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Where
<B>S</B> is the surplus, <B>U</B> is the utility and <B>C</B> is the
cost.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">We
have also previously noticed that the utility of a good depends on
both its intrinsic and extrinsic utilities so we have :</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<B>S = I*E-C</B></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">Where<B>
I</B> is the intrinsic utility and <B>E</B> is the extrinsic utility.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
How do these concepts map to a concrete network such as the Web? The
intrinsic utility of a Web resource (be it a Web page or a complete
Web site) depends on the quality and quantity of its informational
contents (and by how well these match the informational needs of the
user). The number of inbound links (links to the resource from other
resources) affects the acquisition cost: the greater the number of
inbound links the easier, and therefore cheaper, it is to find the
resource in the first place (this applies also to resources located
via search engines as those with a higher number of inbound links
will, <I>ceteris paribus</I>, rank higher in the engine result list).
The number of outbound links (links from the resource to other
resources) determines the extrinsic value of the resource. A page
that links to many other Web pages is more useful than one that does
not. This is why search engines or Web directories are so valuable.
If we use Google, it is not because of the intrinsic value of its
minimalist home page but rather because it provides access to
billions of other resources.</P>

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The implications of power-law distributions in network are numerous
and rather surprising as they mostly derive from two very peculiar,
and somehow opposite, aspects of these distribution. On one side,
being highly skewed, scale-free networks can be heavily influenced by
what happens to just a few of their most connected vertices; and this
is true also for very extensive networks such as the Internet, the
Web or the network of social relationships. On the other side,
power-law distributions have long &lsquo;fat&rsquo; tails. What this
means is that the cumulative weight of the less-endowed vertices can
be very significant. In the following diagram we can see how the
&ldquo;tail&rdquo;, shown in yellow, of a scale-free distribution can
have an area comparable to its &lsquo;head&rsquo;.

One of the critical aspects of network behaviour that is affected by
the skewed nature of scale-free networks is their resistance to
failures and attacks. Scale-free networks have been found to be very
resilient to random failures but, at the same time, potentially very
sensitive to malicious attacks:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>In summary, we find that scale-free networks display a
surprisingly high degree of tolerance against random failures, a
property not shared by their exponential counterparts (random
networks). This robustness is probably the basis of the error
tolerance of many complex systems, ranging from cells to distributed
communication systems. It also explains why, despite frequent router
problems, we rarely experience global network outages or, despite the
temporary unavailability of many web pages, our ability to surf and
locate information on the web is unaffected. However, the error
tolerance comes at the expense of attack survivability: the diameter
of these networks increases rapidly and they break into many isolated
fragments when the most connected nodes are targeted. Such decreased
attack survivability is useful for drug design, but it is less
encouraging for communication systems, such as the Internet or the
WWW. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote250anc" HREF="#sdfootnote250sym"><SUP>250</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
This is illustrated in the following diagram that shows how the
average distance between two vertices in a scale-free network
increases when vertices are removed. If the vertices are removed
randomly, the network is essentially unaffected as almost every
removed vertex will have just a few links. If, on the contrary, the
vertices are removed starting with the most connected ones, as it
might happen in the case of a well-planned attach, the result is a
major loss of connectivity.</P>

To make this more concrete, imagine the effect that it would have on
the WWW if just a few of its key sites &ndash; say Google, Yahoo and
eBay &ndash; were taken down by a cyber-terrorism attack. Though that
would not stop the Web from working, it would certainly significantly
reduce its usefulness for a majority of its users.

Similar considerations apply to other scale-free networks such as the
webs of human sexuality and biological food chains. Sexually
transmitted illnesses can spread very quickly if they affect the most
sexually active individuals, as it might have been the case in the
first phase of the AIDS infection. For the same reason, vaccination
or behavioural changes on the part of the most sexually active
individuals can be extremely effective in stopping an infection.
Similarly, complex food chains can be seriously disrupted if even a

We have mentioned that in addition of being skewed, scale-free
network also feature long tails: a vast quantity of nodes of little
individual importance but that, in aggregate, collect a significant
portion of the total value of the network. Whenever economically
efficient ways of exploiting these long tails exists, the
consequences can be far reaching. This is already apparent in
e-commerce where the idea of &lsquo;Long Tail&rsquo; markets is

A frequently cited and well investigated example is that of online
booksellers. The selection of titles offered by traditional
brick-and-mortar bookshops is limited, compared with the total number
of books in print:</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>Small bookshops and mall-based stores stock
approximately 20.000 unique titles, large independent booksellers
stock approximately 40.000 unique titles, Barnes and Noble and
Borders superstores stock approximately 100.000 unique titles, and
the Barnes and Noble superstore in New York City, reported to be the

It might seem that 250.000, or even 40.000 titles, should be more
than enough to satisfy the informational needs of just about
everybody, especially given that books sales follow a power-law
distribution with a handful of current best-sellers accounting for a
large fraction of total sales. However, online booksellers like
Amazon, that stores over two million titles, have learned that there
is a lot of value to be found in the book market&rsquo;s long tail.
As the following table shows, Amazon makes almost half 50% of its
sales from titles that are beyond the reach of any independent
bookshop and around 30% from titles that cannot be stocked even in

The nature of the WWW as a communication medium is fundamentally
ambiguous. A Web site is, like a TV station or radio station, a
one-to-many communication medium to which users &lsquo;tune it&rsquo;
using their browsers. At the same time though, by radically slashing
broadcasting costs, the WWW has opened the doors of information

The short history of the Web has already seen a number of shifts in
the equilibrium of power between these two tendencies. In its initial

What we see happing on the Web is an example of a common pattern:
both one-to-many and many-to-many networks tend to incorporate, or be
superseded by, hub-and-spoke components or full networks in order to
achieve scalability in content production and distribution.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
There are three major phases, and correlated costs, involved in the
production of information: creating the content, integrating it to
produce a &ldquo;higher-order&rdquo; product and finally distributing
it. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
Many-to-many networks are very scalable in content creation but they
are miserable at content integration and distribution. Think of the
telephone. Millions of communications can take place simultaneously
with an impressive quantity of information being created and
exchanged. But now try to organise an evening out for a group of 10
friends. How would you use the telephone to do it? How many calls
would you need to make to collect all ideas on where to go, discuss
them with everybody involved and then inform them of the final
decision? It is hardly surprising that someone thought of inventing
the teleconference. For the same reasons, and much more effectively,
the invention of e-mail was quickly followed by the electronic
mailing list.

<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
One-to-many (broadcasting) networks have the opposite problem, they
are excellent at content distribution and they can handle small-scale
content integration but they are very limited when it comes to
content creation. Traditional broadcasting services such as TV or the
radio have recognised the problem and, rather inefficiently, tried to
overcome some of the limits inherent in their unidirectional
communication model by trying to establish some kind of feedback
channel by using the telephone, mail or more recently e-mail to allow
the public to ask questions, provide short commentaries or request a
song. But this is a far cry from being able to exploit the true
content creation potential of the general public, and in particular
of the one billion people that have Internet access, that, as Yochai
Benkler reminds us, is huge compared with that of the professional

The key point that Reed makes here is not so much that the value of
group-forming networks grows exponentially but rather that, as the
number of user increases, the value that derives from group-forming
grows faster than the value deriving from broadcasting or direct
one-to-one communication leading to a shift in the relative
importance of different network services:  
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT SIZE=2>there are really at least three categories of value that
networks can provide: the linear value of services that are aimed at
individual users, the &quot;square&quot; value from facilitating
transactions, and exponential value from facilitating group
affiliations. What's important is that the dominant value in a
typical network tends to shift from one category to another as the
scale of the network increases. .. We can see this scale-driven value
shift in the history of the Internet. The earliest usage of the
Internet was dominated by its role as a terminal network, allowing
many terminals to selectively access a small number of costly
timesharing hosts. As the Internet grew, much more of the usage and
value of the Internet became focused on pairwise exchanges of email
messages, files, etc. following Metcalfe's Law. And as the Internet
started to take off in the early ' 90's, traffic started to be
dominated by &quot;newsgroups&quot; (Internet discussion groups),
user created mailing lists, special interest websites, etc.,
following the exponential GFN law. Though the previously dominant
functions did not lose value or decline as the scale of the Internet
grew, the value and usage of services that scaled by newly dominant
scaling laws grew faster&hellip; What's important in a network
changes as the network scale shifts. In a network dominated by linear
connectivity value growth, &quot;content is king.&quot; That is, in
such networks, there is a small number of sources (publishers or
makers) of content that every user selects from. The sources compete
for users based on the value of their content (published stories,
published images, standardized consumer goods). Where Metcalfe's Law
dominates, transactions become central. The stuff that is traded in
transactions (be it email or voice mail, money, securities,
contracted services, or whatnot) are king. And where the GFN law
dominates, the central role is filled by jointly constructed value
(such as specialized newsgroups, joint responses to RFPs, gossip,
etc.). <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote268anc" HREF="#sdfootnote268sym"><SUP>268</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

Empirical confirmation of the shift in importance from broadcasting

<FONT SIZE=2>The predominance of point-to-point communications
spending is not new. That has been the historical pattern for ages.
For example, in the early 19th century, almost all the revenues of
the U.S. postal system came from letters. Yet about as many
newspapers as letters were being delivered &hellip; it was often
thought (even by Alexander Graham Bell) that one of the principal
uses of the telephone would be in broadcasting. Several substantial
experiments in delivering content over the phone were attempted,
including the Telefon Hirmond&oacute; in Budapest that lasted from
1893 past the end of World War I, and the Telephone Herald in Newark,
New Jersey, which folded soon after its start in 1911. In the end,
though, the phone emerged as the prototypical example of
point-to-point communication. &hellip;Today, Web traffic dominates
the Internet in volume, with about 20 times as many bytes as email &hellip;
Yet email has been and continues to be the real &ldquo;killer app&rdquo;
of the Internet. ... Ask people whether they would rather give up
email or the phone, and the responses will typically be split.
However, when a similar choice is offered between the Web and email,
there is no contest. This is true for both individuals and large
organizations. Intranets are all the rage, but it is email that makes
enterprises run.<SUP><FONT COLOR="#000000"> </FONT></SUP><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote271anc" HREF="#sdfootnote271sym"><SUP>271</SUP></A></SUP></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>The value of a broadcast network is usually regarded as
proportional to the number of users in it. On the other hand, a
point-to-point communication network is often said, by Metcalfe&rsquo;s
Law, to have value proportional to the square of the number of
member. This then leads to the conclusion that eventually, once a
single network like the Internet reaches a large enough size,
point-to-point communications will provide much higher value than
broadcast. There are some problems with this argument &hellip;
However, the general thrust of the argument and the conclusion are
valid. Certainly all the historical evidence cited throughout this
work supports the conclusion that connectivity (or point-to-point
communication) is what matters the most. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote272anc" HREF="#sdfootnote272sym"><SUP>272</SUP></A></SUP></FONT></FONT></P>

	From the point of view of an unprivileged user (the situation is
	different for the Wiki&rsquo;s administrators) a Wiki is essentially
	a set of two functions. The first is a retrieval function that,
	given the title of a page and a version number, will return the
	content of the specified version of the page. The other is a
	publishing function that, given the title of a page and a text, will
	append a new version with the given text to the existing list of
	versions of the page with the given title. These functions are
	<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">referentially
	transparent</A></U></FONT>, that is to say that, given the same
	parameters, they always produce the same result. <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency">Referential
	transparency</A></U></FONT> is also a key feature of one of the
	latest breeds of programming languages: the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional">purely
	functional</A></U></FONT> programming languages. In these languages,
	existing values cannot be modified, though new values can be created
	on the base of the existing ones. Wikis offers some of the same
	advantages of functional programming languages: simplicity and
	resilience to concurrent modifications.</P>

	One of the main attractions of the Wikis is that they allow users to

	As the page that contains the &ldquo;official&rdquo; aims of
	Wikipedia is, just as any other page, editable by anybody, the exact
	wording might vary. There is no doubt though that the creation of an
	encyclopaedia, in the traditional sense of the term but with

	This applies only to the specifically encyclopaedic part of
	Wikipedia, that is to say the entries. Wikipedia includes also
	debating facilities, mostly in the form of Talk pages of which there
	is one per entry, that are used to discuss the contents and
	development of the corresponding article. Unsurprisingly, the
	language adopted in these discussion areas is informal, colloquial

	It seems unlikely that more than a few of the international versions
	of Wikipedia will ever reach the status of universal encyclopedias.
	The value of the smaller versions will rather be in providing a
	focus for the preservation of minority languages and cultures that
	are currently under-represented on the Web. This is even more
	evident in the related <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</A></U></FONT>
	project, a Wiki-based open content dictionary where, among the top
	ten dictionaries by size, we find minority languages such as
	<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician">Galician</A></U></FONT>
	and the artificial language Ido (last checked on the 28<SUP>th</SUP>
	of November 2005). The minor editions of Wikipedia are one more
	example of how the Internet can strengthen minority groups and
	customs. For an even more peculiar case, see The Economist, <I>Made

	Wikipedia has also put in place other procedures to defend its
	contents. The English Wikipedia has an Arbitration Committee that
	has the power of black-listing the worst offenders excluding them
	from further editing. Automatic mechanisms also exist to detect and
	stop the most common patterns of misconduct. So, for example, in
	order to stop &lsquo;editing wars&rsquo; where authors keep
	reversing a page to their favourite version, so removing all
	successive edits, there is a &quot;three reverts rule&quot;, whereby
	those users who revert articles more than three times in a 24 hour
	period are blocked for 24 hours.</P>

	One caveat is in order. Wikipedia is heavily interlinked, with each
	entry typically referring to many other entries. In July 2005,
	Wikipedia had <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wikistats/EN/TablesDatabaseWords.htm">491M

	internal links, that is to say one internal link every 16 words! It
	is not clear what weight Google gives to links that originate from
	the same Web site as the linked resource. If they do influence the
	total ranking then Wikipedia entries might be seen as authoritative
	simply because other Wikipedia entries suggest so.

	ACOs can be seen, though it is a long shot, as a form of genetic
	algorithm where the &lsquo;crossover&rsquo; function, used to
	determine the new individuals&rsquo; genome, has access to the whole
	population genetic pool and it depends on the fitness of the
	population genes, rather than on the fitness of individuals, as it
	is the case in biological systems and in most genetic algorithms.
	The equivalence between ACOs and genetic algorithms can be
	established as follows:</P>

	Concerns over the impact of IP on developing nations has lead, among
	many other initiatives, to the definition of special licenses that
	allow free commercial and non-commercial exploitation of IP in
	developing countries while maintaining traditional IP rights in
	developed nations (see the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/license/devnations">Creative

	problem is the underinvestment in technologies to address the
	specific need of the third world, e.g. drugs to fight tropical
	diseases or low cost water-filtering or computing. Some notable
	initiatives in this area are the research and development program to

	Networks with power-law distributions of links are referred to as
	scale-free. Formally, scale-free refers to functions, of which power
	laws are the only example, that remains unchanged to within a
	multiplicative factor under a rescaling of the independent variable
	<B>x</B> so that <B>f(a x) = b f(x)</B>. Scale-free distributions
	are self-similar, the distribution for a certain range of values of
	the independent variable looks like the whole distribution. One
	interesting implication of this fact is that, if you can measure the
	distribution for a certain range of values, you can extrapolate this
	to get the whole distribution.

	The distribution of software usage might also be scale-free with a
	few basic applications (email, Web browsing, word processing)
	apparently stealing the show but really being followed by a very
	long tail of increasingly specific and largely under-serviced
	functionality. Easy-to-use universally customisable applications
	would be needed to address the &ldquo;long tail of software&rdquo;.
	The search for this veritable Holy Grail of software design seems
	now to be moving on the Web with a number of attempts at providing
	environments for the quick development of custom applications (for
	example: <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.ning.com/">Ning</A></U></FONT>

	These are just analytical distinctions and concrete WWW publishers
	often share characteristics of all these types. So, for example,
	Amazon is not just a commercial one-to-many site promoting its own
	products but it is also an extremely efficient knowledge refinery
	that leads the way in e-commerce for its skill in eliciting and
	exploiting knowledge on consumption patterns and user preferences to
	make the customer experience more satisfying and engaging and

	An agent that desires to exchange good A with good B in a barter
	economy has to find another agent that desires to exchange good B
	with good A. If every agent holds an average of <I>n</I> goods, the
	probability of an agent holding one out of a total of N goods is <SUB>
	<IMG SRC="ska_html_m168d2770.gif" NAME="Object1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=41></SUB>.
	If similarly, each agent desires to acquire <I>v</I> goods, then the
	probability of an agent desiring a certain good out of a total of N
	goods is <SUB>
	<IMG SRC="ska_html_ma50d5e6.gif" NAME="Object2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=41></SUB>.
	The probability of finding an agent that desires to exchange good B

	Under the reasonable assumption that the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_costs">transaction
	cost</A></U></FONT> <I>c</I>, that is to say the overhead costs
	involved in performing the barter, is proportional to the reciprocal

	In a complex economy, where N is large, transaction costs would be

	than the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus">consumer
	surplus</A></U></FONT> that the agent can derive from the exchange.
	In a monetary economy, an agent needs only to find someone that
	desires good A and then someone that offers good B. The probability
	of this combination of events is <SUB>
	<IMG SRC="ska_html_5b94aec1.gif" NAME="Object5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=72 HEIGHT=49></SUB>and

	Similarly to the barter vs. monetary economy example the reduction
	in connection cost is dramatic, from quadratic, in the case of a
	many-to-many topology, down to just linear in the number of nodes
	for the hub-and-spoke solution. If N nodes are interconnected
	directly that requires N (N-1) interconnections and correspondingly
	quadratic costs. If they interconnect through a hub only N
	connections are needed.</P>
