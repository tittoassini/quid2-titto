<p>Breadcrumbs ... deevloping the javascript RDF tabulator code</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>Javascript weirdnesses</h2>

<p>Coming forom python (and before that Objective C and C) the strageest
thing was the iterations over arrays which don't in fact gve the array
elements but their indexes</p>

<p></p>

<p>- Safari bug:</p>

<p></p>

<p>when you read the innerHTML of an element, it is a mixed content, but the
&lt; in the text are not escaped. You therefore can't read it and write it
back again. This bug does not existin Firefox. Javascript weirdnesses: for (x
in myArray) does not make x iterate through the members of myArray, but
through the indeces!  It is the same as (more or less) fot x in
range(len((myArray)) in pythonm, not for x in myArray.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>No network access</h3>

<p></p>

<p>i had to work offline when deevloping. The XMLHTTP method is just that --
it gets XML using HTTP. So running in file: space was not possible my mapping
URIs.</p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>In System Preferences, under Sharing, turn on "Web sharing"</li>
  <li>Make soft links as folows:</li>
</ol>

<p></p>
<pre>$ cd /Library/Webserver/Documents

$ ln -s /devel/WWW/2000 2000
$ ln -s /devel/WWW/2001 2001

$ ln -s /devel/WWW/2002 2002
$ ln -s /devel/WWW/2003 2003
$ ln -s /devel/WWW/2004 2004
$ ln -s /devel/WWW/2006 2006

</pre>

<p>And in the script, I put a URI mapper which wirks when the document.domain
is 'localhost'. SiteMap[ "http://www.w3.org/" ] =</p>

<p> "http://localhost/www.w3.org/"  // Salt to taste</p>

<p></p>

<p>The server does need security: not good to give access to all the
filesystem</p>

<p></p>
<pre>Notes on local apache server
Need mod_rewrite.c
# Try this:
LoadModule rewrite_module     libexec/httpd/mod_rewrite.so
AddModule mod_rewrite.c# Authentication 
- local access only to this server
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule   ^/$  /devel/WWW/
&lt;Directory /devel/WWW/&gt;
Order Deny,Allow
Deny from all
Allow from localhost
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

<p>- Using the RDF API to test it out</p>
